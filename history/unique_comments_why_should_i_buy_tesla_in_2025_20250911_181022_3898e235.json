Unless they remove electric vehicles from the face of the earth, I am not going back to internal combustion. I am just hoping toward that end of the year they will have some low APR deal (but that&#39;s too soon and wishful thinking hehe) on the Juniper as well and...bye-bye-bye  BMW 640i. Love my BMW, but premium gasoline price out here in CA is ridiculous!",

      "text": "Took delivery of my 2025 Model 3 just a few days ago. I tried the autopilot as soon as the cameras finished their calibration. All the hype I heard from Tesla vloggers…all true! The autopilot basically drove 80% of the time. The other 20% was me always wanting to “take the wheel”.<br><br>Took about 5-10 minutes of driving after getting in the driver’s seat to get hang of the basics including the touch screen and steering controls. <br><br>Regen braking took four stoplights to get the hang of it. Ngl, I am glad I waited to get one, but slight regret for not getting one sooner.<br><br>Yeah, FSD is awesome. I will miss it when my 30 day trial is up, hehe. But it is good to know that $100 per month is available when I go on long road trips, i.e. : from home to Zion, home to Vegas, home to Yosemite/Sequoia/Redwood/etc national parks, home to Big Bear, so on and so on. FSD is quite convenient in terms of it adjusting speed and changing lanes while I am observing throughout the drive.",

Then, I discovered that with Tesla insurance, which is always monitoring and reporting my driving to Big Brother Telsa,  if I used my monthly FSD subscription for most of my normal, daily routine driving, my rates plummeted compared to other insurance companies.  They are now similar to what I pay for my nicely appointed Mazda CX-5 turbo.  The savings over the cheapest non-Tesla insurance I could find almost pays for the FSD subscription.  The savings does indeed depend on my level of enthusiasm with my right foot and corning but the monthly rate calculation is rather tolerant of my fun with maybe a $30 per month &quot;penalty&quot;....but it&#39;s still way cheaper than other insurance.  Check it out.",

The interface is somewhat different in Model S and X years prior to 2022.

Been driving it for 7 months and it’s the best and most fun car I’ve ever driven.   I drive to see clients for work during the week and actually don’t particularly enjoy being on the road all the time,  but  experiencing a Tesla for the first time  felt like learning to drive anew - and I actually look forward to driving now because the car is so freakin’ amazing on all levels! Also bought your TessStuff Floor Mats too- very minimalist design, functional  and easy to clean!   <br><br>I would add to your video list that for me personally , Tesla’s App is the best car app I’ve ever experienced. I leased two Ford Edge Performances (2018 &amp; 2021) before my Tesla, and the Ford apps sucked big time- never worked and glitchy - and toward the end of my last lease, it stopped working all together.  I have never had a bad experience with Tesla’s app so far and I absolutely love Tesla’s leading edge Technology and frequent updates.   I can’t imagine ever going back to driving an ICE car again.  Thanks for all you do to educate and enlighten us!",

US market they made up less than half ev sales (huge downturn) they only made about 25% in AU, VW sold more in europe, and obviously chinese brands dominate china (though thats mostly due to quality not elon). Tesla shut down production for 3 weeks, not even a whole month, they have ridiculous inventory, and sales are down for every single model, NOT JUST THE Y. I can&#39;t fathom how you can seriously say there&#39;s no brand damage or their in a good spot relative to how they were this time 1 year ago.

Yes I bought an adapter to use at supercharger stations and you know what? It works great! It&#39;s a non-issue in my opinion. Regarding electrify America and other networks, I find the key is to download the app for the respective Network and simply pull up the location I&#39;m headed to so I can check the status of the charging stations ahead of time. I used this method to go from Ohio to New York and back. We encountered exactly zero problems. Chargeway proved to be a particularly helpful app.",

I appreciate the discussion; I think in the end Tesla is in a unique place as an auto manufacturer due to the other industries they&#39;re involved in. It&#39;s crazy that Robotaxi is about to launch in Austin in &lt;45 days... The next step of Tesla&#39;s incredible future is nearly here and I&#39;m just hoping for the best with it. If/when it&#39;s expanded to Atlanta, I&#39;ll be itching to try it.",

Sure, some vehicles hold their value better, but a car to me isn&#39;t an investment. Investments appreciate, they don&#39;t depreciate. The lesson is to buy a used Tesla with low mileage. It still has a 100,000 to 150,000 mile warranty on the battery and motors. There are GREAT deals out there! The depreciation is already happened. You&#39;re getting a similar vehicle for half the price! I&#39;ve also checked into insurance, and you have to shop around. $4000 is ridiculous. I&#39;ve gotten quotes HALF that.",

I also do not fear being vandalize because that’s a result of a mentality and I’m sure within a couple months, the mob will move on some other hot topic issue, and within a year or two people will forget about whatever Elon did. Except for the Internet trolls, of course. I will not let the temporal nature of politics affect good purchases. Also, I find all comparisons to protesting Tesla to the civil right movement to be absolutely disgusting and incomparable. Thanks for the good and honest video, guys.",

      "text": "The backlash against Tesla isn’t overblown. People aren’t vandalizing Teslas because they object to electric vehicles — they’re reacting to what Elon Musk, personally, represents. This isn’t just about cars. It’s about the values attached to a brand whose CEO actively engages in divisive rhetoric and policy signaling. You don’t see widespread vandalism against brands like Porsche or BMW, even though they also sell luxury vehicles. The intensity directed at Tesla is different — it’s personal, political, and deeply social.<br><br>To be clear, vandalism isn’t acceptable. But it’s also not random. It’s a more extreme, visible expression of a broader sentiment — shared by many who feel betrayed, alienated, or threatened by Musk’s public stances. While most express their frustration peacefully — through protest, critique, or simply choosing not to buy in — the vandalism reflects the emotional depth of that dissent. It’s not just about a product. It’s about what that product now symbolizes to millions of people.<br><br>And Tesla doesn’t deserve uncritical praise just because it’s leading in EV sales or software. Full Self-Driving (FSD), for example, was declared “feature-complete” back in 2019 by Elon Musk. As of 2024, it still requires driver supervision and remains under active regulatory scrutiny. Tesla has consistently missed self-imposed timelines. The pattern is clear: big promises, delayed delivery, and little accountability.<br><br>More broadly, saying that we don’t need to think about who we support as consumers is a privileged position. The reality is, branding isn’t just about performance — it’s about identity. The clothes we wear, the cars we drive, the platforms we use — they all say something, whether consciously or not. And when there’s a choice, we can choose to align with brands that reflect our values, even if imperfectly.<br><br>This isn&#39;t about purity. It&#39;s about accountability. In the 1960s, when Black Americans were forced to sit at the back of the bus, they didn’t say, “It’s just a seat.” They boycotted. Because how you spend your money — or withhold it — is power. If a business leader supports policies that harm refugees, promote division, or signal a disregard for human dignity, choosing not to support that company isn’t performative. It’s principled.<br><br>And when that same leader welcomes White South Africans as “desirable” immigrants while showing indifference or hostility toward political refugees fleeing war and persecution, the message couldn’t be clearer. It&#39;s not about immigration — it’s about whose humanity they prioritize. Choosing to boycott in response to that isn’t extreme. It’s a peaceful, powerful act of alignment.",

I can handle $172 a month.     I do not like the Safety Score and I&#39;ll tell you why.  It&#39;s very bad for you and your Tesla Insurance cost when things happen that aren&#39;t your fault...someone turns in front of you from a fast food joint or whatever on a main road at the last second, someone rides their brakes, you are trying to use regenerative braking and a yellow light turns red as you realize you are going to coast into the middle of the crossroad if you don&#39;t actually hit the brakes.   Stuff like that, especially during the first month of ownership for new Tesla drivers.   Tesla Insurance started for me at $185 for my first month of ownership.   Today, I was going to be autopaying $265 for my second month of insurance.   I called BS and cancelled.  I went back to $172 and I don&#39;t have to worry about drive score or Safety Score app.    Both Safety Score and Tesla Insurance can eat my ass.    You shouldn&#39;t have to drive a Tesla like a grandma.   You shouldn&#39;t be all stressed out over Safety Score, especially just after being happy you got a new car.   That&#39;s all I have to say about it.     \r<br>\r<br>Thank you for your awesome videos!",

I say if you want one be sure you are within 25 miles of a Service Center and be sure that a Tesla labor rate of $240 an hour does not bother you.  I also say if you break down in podunk Georgia any mechanic can do something about an ICE vehicle.  But for an EV you have to take it to a Tesla Service center.  Part of this is that Tesla has systems that are so different that only Tesla can fix them.  For example I had to have the cooling manifold and radiator (not same radiator as in an ICE vehicle) replaced because of a water leak that forced the car to not run....cost $2800.  Otherwise get one and have fun and unload it just before the warranty expires.",

It got totaled in a car accident (not my fault) a couple of months ago and I replaced it with a 2025 Model 3. I couldn’t NOT get another Tesla. It’s such a fantastic car and the updated Model 3 is even better with improved styling and features. There will be pros and cons with any car purchase. For me the pros by far outweigh the cons described in this video. My non-Tesla friends and family could not understand my decision to buy another Tesla. My Tesla owner friends totally get it because it’s such a leap into the future that once you go there, you just can’t go back in time to gas cars or EVs that don’t have the charging network.",

Then you get states like CT or SC(places I live),  that have almost no public chargers or service places.  I live near Hilton head in SC and the nearest service center is 1.5hrs away, in CT they are only a couple down by the shore.   Only a few Superchargers in either state, that are along major highways and way out of the way.",

Just swapping sides<br>2. There is a camber on the tires to accommodate the air suspension that causes the tire to wear unevenly and even faster than other models<br>3. The tire sizes are difficult to find at low prices so you tend to only have an option for a more expensive tire because they simply don&#39;t make it in these non-standard sizes",

For that trip, the charging costs have been (roughly) $8 charging at home, then two $8 sessions at Superchargers.  That works out to about 85%ish of the cost of gas for taking the same trip in our Prius.  Now, yes, it would be more if it were <i>all</i> Supercharged, rather than about half of it charged from home.  Then again, it would be a lot more expensive than Prius if I were driving a comparable gas car, like, say, a BMW X3.",

However, when it was time to rotate the tires, I called Tesla mobile service, they came out, took a few measurements, and said, “why bother?”  The wear was pretty much identical front to rear.  Granted, maybe I’m an unusual case, or maybe not, but it’s AWD, and I don’t do any crazy acceleration (short of avoiding some sort of emergency).<br><br>Now, if it were our Prius, I’m sure Toyota service would not miss any opportunity to rotate the tires, both for the service revenue and because it’s a FWD vehicle, so the front tires most definitely do wear a lot faster than the rears.",

      "text": "I’m in Illinois and registration was $400 the first year, but this last year it dropped down to about $200. Which is about what I would have been paying for my ICE car. And as far as driving long distances, I went to Rochester Minnesota with my mom without any issues. The two times we stopped we ate and went to the bathroom, maybe waited a few extra minutes to charge to 80%. I totally forgot to change my charge limit but it worked out great. I don’t usually go on road trips so range was never a huge issue. I brought my mobile charger just in case. I got my MY 2023 because I loved how fast it was, I’m a crazy driver and I do use my breaks from time to time, still on factory tires, so it’s not a problem for me.",

I had a Tesla Model S to use as a local car only. But it cost me 6 grand to fix the technical issues I had with it. 6 thousand dollars to fix a damn car that has no engine!! I sold it and got rid of it. I never had to spend that kind of money to fix any car I ever had in all my 45 years of driving. As a serious long-range traveler I&#39;ll keep my XJL and it&#39;s 570 miles of range which is not available in any Tesla. I&#39;ll keep the gas. Money I have time I don&#39;t. Up and out in 2.5 minutes. I wish Tesla had these same fine features and qualities that are currently reserved for gas cars only. When I too my Tesla to Brumal Pennsylvania to get fixed, the good people there told me quote, &quot;Have patients my friend for that day is coming&quot; so I&#39;m going to simply wait for Tesla to finally come out with an EV designed to deliver for the serious long-range traveler like me...",

If large and luxurious to large full size and luxurious didn&#39;t matter to me, I would have the same thing my cousin has, also a serious long-range traveler. The Jaguar FX20D which delivers a range of 731 miles. I need a car that can deliver, not loaded up with a whole lot of tech which does absolutely nothing but makes the simplicities of driving more complex. I&#39;m talking about shorter downtimes and much longer ranges which sorry to say, Tesla doesn&#39;t even make. I&#39;m waiting for the M7 SUV EV hybrid to arrive from China. Over 800 miles of range. We&#39;ll see what happens down the road. I&#39;m just glad you have the wisdom to atleast understand what I&#39;m talking about.",

      "text": "For me? The very best time to buy a Tesla is when Tesla comes out with a large and luxurious model that delivers for the serious long-range, long-distance traveler.   Shorter downtimes for charging and a great travel range of (atleast) 500 miles. One of the reasons why most want nothing to do with Tesla or EVs in America 🇺🇸. Now they put up and offer all these incentives and tax credits. Sorry but I can finance my own Tesla and I don&#39;t need no fancy lures or incentives. All I need is Tesla to make a large and luxurious model that delivers for long range travels. One that has a dashboard with class and style like Lucid air or BYD. How about shorter down times for charging? Ok so maybe not 2.5 to 3.5 minutes which is the time it takes me to refuel my Jaguar XJL but how about atleast 5 to 10 minutes? How about a great travel range? Ok so maybe not 570 miles of range my Jaguar XJL delivers but how about atleast, (atleast) 500 miles of range or better? Deliver this, now we&#39;re talkin!! I&#39;ll buy one immediately and without all the fancy lures and deceptions. The travel model would be good enough to sell itself. Till then I&#39;ll keep my XJL and the 570 miles of range and simply leave more than well enough alone.",

You can google search the nearest charge stations and you’ll find some in parking garages that forces you to pay the parking fees while your charging your car. Sometimes that happens not always but if you are out of juice and really need to charge you don’t have a choice and pay extra. Many times you go to a charging station and there’s a massive lines because guess what? Issue number one AND it typically takes 45 minutes to an hour to fully charge your car and the price for that full charge is usually around $20-25 USD. Also one more issue. Your drive time is short compared to petrol cars. Starting off from a full battery After about 3.5 hours of drive time. You’re down to 70% battery then guess what? Issue number one and two arises.",

If you’re relying on superchargers, they can get pretty expensive to where the savings are not nearly as much.  The equivalent to driving a gas car that gets around 35 mpg.  Still More efficient than most cars sure but I think most people assume the savings are drastic no matter what.",

My Optiwatt app that is linked to my power company rate information says that I have only spent around $500 in electricity for 50k miles. I only supercharged for the amount of $10.  Of course, I did my due diligence on switching my power plan to the time-of-use plan which is 40-50% cheaper than the on-peak rate. Plus, on-peak is only during the months of June to August from 2pm to 8pm. How cool is that?",

It’s just economics, there are far fewer mechanics who can repair a Tesla and a fender bender is costly since there are 20 cameras and sensors all over the car, and insurance companies are well aware. Also, although it’s better than years before, the energy infrastructure for road tripping isn’t optimized for EVs. You can’t just “expect” to find a place to recharge at any old place along a long trip, it takes advanced planning for the whole round trip just in case your hotel at your final destination doesn’t have a charger. Despite this, I still enjoy the car and I’d get another.",

Most people have to travel for work and if you are like me it can be 20 miles one way and 20 miles back. If I&#39;m on call at a different hospital it can be further. Depends on the needs in a given shift. So a Tesla for me would be a waste when I drive alot. When you buy a vehicle you should consider roadtrips when buying it. Say you have family in New york and you live in Florida. Now that&#39;s about a 18hr trip. If you take your fancy EV it can turn that trip into 30hrs reguardless of the miles you get in charging. You aren&#39;t factoring in the weather, wind, road condiitions, traffic etc. Not sure if you have driven that trek but if you havn&#39;t there is alot of traffic when you head north and get into the citys like washignton DC, Baltimore, etc. You see where I&#39;m going with this right? I can fill my vehcile up 3-4 times on my way up and make it in one night while it would take you longer. Yes the chargers are fun and have things you can do, but when you want to get somewhere the drive can get to be enough and you want to just get there. So while we are saying that electic is the way to go yes it is but there are alot of things that need to be fixed. Tesla&#39;s weren&#39;t made for cooler weather and the miles you have don&#39;t nessesary reflect what you will be truly getting. I know with my vehcile exactly what I&#39;m getting and how much I will spend in gas on average.",

They keep bragging that doing all the charging at home will keep it &quot;free.&quot; What if they charge a homeowner&#39;s tax on your solar panels? Then they say &quot;Pfft! I&#39;ll just build one.&quot;  Then they raise your electric rates and your bills climb 10% in only one month. I&#39;ve lived under privatized electric companies and it is NOT cheap. Living alone in a 800 sq ft house, I once got a utilties bill (electricity only) for a whopping $250 in 2009. Ouch. I can&#39;t imagine how bad it would be with Bidenflation added....",

Almost 2 months ago, I bought a Y LR AWD Ultra Red 7-seater with a white interior for around $35K after tax incentives, inventory discounts, and referral discounts. <br><br>A few days ago, we leased my wife a Stealth Grey Y LR RWD 5-seater with a white interior. So with both transactions, we save nearly $33K! So with that said, I think buying new is the better way to go. But maybe not for long if the incentives go away as rumored. Which would be beneficial to newer owners that recently took advantage of the incentives, as we will have some built-in equity.",

          "text": "Residual is in the fine print below but it’s higher than it should be. I think Tesla is discouraging the customer from buying out the lease. They want you to return it. The monthly is really good, but the residual is too expensive. However the model 3 long range RWD only gets a special lease deal that’s out rn which means even if you buy out the car, you’re only paying about the same as msrp which isn’t bad. Only that trim though. Others will be 5-8k over msrp to buy out. Cash or financing rn (0% for model 3) is way better than planning to buy with lease unless you get base 3 rn before that deal goes away",

At the end of the lease you have the option of buying the car for Y dollars.  If X&lt;Y, congrats, you avoided a lot of depreciation and moved on.  If X&gt;Y, you paid a nominal amount extra for the lease to lock in a lower price or the dealership is paying you money to take the car back.<br><br>If X is way &lt; than Y, you could either negotiate a discount for the buyout with the dealer or buy someone else’s lease return for way less than your car would have been worth had you bought originally.<br><br><br>If you compare it to buying a 7 year old Toyota for 20K up front, yes the calculus changes but that’s not a fair comparison.  There also no used Junipers to buy at the moment.",

Tesla acts like it hasn&#39;t significantly changed the Y between 21 and 24, but it handles better, feels better, tighter.<br>Yes, I went through debating if I should wait for the new Y Jupiter, but glad I didn&#39;t.

The Juniper Y Performance will be amazing and I will be ready soon after they are.<br>Leasing is way cheaper than owning on a monthly basis and it is impossible to not get upside down on a loan in less than 5 years.

I used the fed. rebate to ppf/wrap my vehicle (they now make this as a combined ppf).  That was $4300.  If you spend that much on a vehicle you love, then you should also protect the floors with better mats ($700) and a simple screen protector ($30).  I got lots of other non-essentials, but that was more my ego.  I had to get it now, since my Jeep will no longer pass inspection without major $$$.  She was 20 years old and has seen better days (lol).  The only major negative so far is the dramatic increase in my insurance rate (from $65 to $230/month w/ USAA).  But I absolutely LOVE driving this thing.",

Most people I know live in apartments not houses and this trend is growing as the cost of living keeps getting higher and higher.  Garages at apartment buildings don’t have individual charging ports at each stall so you have to go to a charging station every time you need to fill up.  Very inconvenient to have an EV and charge it in this way.  If you have a house it is a great way to keep and manage an suv.  I personally wouldn’t get one until I get a house.",

I bought a 2018 Model 3 Performance with FSD used from Tesla at an awesome price last year, and considering I can transfer the $12k software to the new one is one of the biggest decision-makers. Also, getting a Model Y Performance  with white interior for 42700 after federal tax credit is amazing. Tesla did not actually try to low-ball me on the trade-in value of the Model 3P either. I actually was impressed that they beat Carvana&#39;s price and was very close to CarMax&#39;s trade-in value (which also used give low-ball offers). However, since I live in Kentucky, and the vehicle tax here is 6%, I had to take advantage of the fact that as long as you trade in and purchase from the same dealer, you only pay a prorated amount (less the previous vehicle&#39;s tax value).",

I took my 2023 Model Y long range for wheel balancing in Fort Worth TX service centre. It was vibrating at high speeds 60+ mph. The car returned back with more vibrations at all speeds. They charged me for two wheels but gave me one warped wheel and replaced my suspension with the old set. So they stole away my luxury of driving a new Tesla. <br>I went to Plano Tesla , they replace the warped wheel with a new one without any charge but didn’t do anything for the suspension.

I normally keep Perl, my Model Y LR (AWD) in CHILL mode (which limits torque, somewhat) in an effort to make my tires (and presumably other parts of the drivetrain)  last longer.  Fortunately I was in Standard mode on when the minor accident almost happened. While I was attempting to change lanes after discovering belatedly (I was on a long trip, and didn&#39;t know the area) that I was in the wrong lane, I spied a pickup closing quickly in the rearview mirror, .... don&#39;t you just hate out-of-towners that don&#39;t know that the leftmost lane at a particular intersection is a U-Turn ONLY? Well, one of them may have been me. I apologize. Anyway, at my foot&#39;s urging, Perl pulled instantly away from the potential impact and I was able to move back into a lane from which I could execute the desired left turn.  Henceforward, I think I&#39;ll stay in CHILL mode when driving in familiar territory, but switch to Standard when navigating strange streets.",

Is there a model year or newer that I should stick with, to take full advantage of firmware updates, due to the hardware limitations of earlier years?",

          "text": "@@anna-sj9cpI have taken three road trips in a Hertz rental Model 3 and the Model Y is certainly  more comfortable in the entry and exit process, I felt like I had to &quot;fall&quot; into the Model 3 and climb back out of it at my destination, not good.  My neighbor has a 2022 Model Y which I have driven and the seat is  more at my height level (6&#39;0) and it is easier to get in and out of.   I have already purchased my Exped MegaMat Model Y  sleeping pad for the back and plan on sleeping in it on road trips where it may come in handy.   The CT was originally supposed to have environmentals in the back but that plan was scraped sadly. I also have the tent that attaches to the rear of the car for changing space and breathing room if I ever need it.  Also in the toy bag is the ICECO refrigerator/freezer which was a sweet treat on the aforementioned road trips.  <br><br>I have my sights set on the Model Y &quot;Juniper&quot; upgrade with ALL the bells and whistles and it looks like it may be in production the 1st Quarter of 2025.  I did not know I could go ahead and put in a preorder for it so I will check into that promptly, thanks for the heads up.",

I live in Thailand ( Bangkok) .... so we have a few differences.<br>Price of gasoline is...$1 pl, our gas stations are all serviced meaning you don&#39;t get out of your car to fill up... means you don&#39;t get out in to the heat of the sun.<br>Our Supercharge network is much less limited.<br>We don&#39;t get reduced overnight rates on electricity.<br>We don&#39;t get a EV rebate  on purchase.<br>Our insurance is higher (given our roads are chaos and our average driver is of a lower quality standard ) that not being harsh, we have the highest rate of accidents in the world.<br><br>Next our climate is hot average 33C.... I like the full glass  sunroof, but oh boy do we need that tinted glass... our normal car has 60% tinted glass and you can still feel the heat. An automatic sun shade would be a big essential.<br>Rain.... we have a 4-5 month rain season and it can be biblical... so the window wipers have to be ultra high performance and adjustable speeds really fast<br><br>Lights.. our current car has auto lights as per when it gets dark the lights com on automatically .... ( tunnels, shade and entering underground car parks)... I don&#39;t want to keep going to a screen to change the settings.<br><br>Getting charger at home is offered free... however the wall mounted ones are still a better choice and are not free.<br><br>Our daily milage (km) is very low so less than $150 our month anyway....<br><br>Lets say i&#39;m maybe not a range worrying freak..... other than 10 times a year would I need to think about a long road trip.... 300 Miles or more<br><br>There are a few Tesla&#39;s here and certainly getting more popular.<br><br>Don&#39;t need the full autopilot, the standard one is very ample.... lets say as above other road users are not lane disciplined so under taking and drivers who drive like Grand Theft Auto is very common.<br><br>Agree that many of the accessories your recommend  are essential for enhancing the experience.<br><br>The driving as reported on an EV is slightly different to a normal car..... any change of car it takes a little time for you and car to feel as one anyway.<br><br> Off road... not the full Land Rover experience... but dirt tracks , non tarmac roads, sand roads and lets be honest..... soggy wet grass roads..... Now a big issue in rain season... we get frequent street flooding of at leat 12 inches or more.... does that mean I can&#39;t use the car to wade slowly though flooding points ?<br><br>In 8 years our milage is  under 70,000 miles<br><br> Its tempting to switch..... very tempting.... I&#39;m a more mature driver, so today its comfort not speed, but with the ability of a  quick acceleration if and when you need it is an excellent idea.<br><br>Will I switch?...... Yes, but maybe not today..... still a few to many unsure aspects... advise very welcome",

      "text": "You were right about not test drive a tesla if you not prepared to buy a tesla. I always thought EV are soulless without the roaring of the engine. Until my kids said they want to sit in a tesla so I took them for a test drive. I ended up ordering the model x after we got back to the dealership. The acceleration and torque is something you can only feel if you spent money on a fossil fuel supercar. I test drove the Model X LR and its probably faster than 95% of the cars on the road for that price it was no brainer. lol So far I&#39;m loving it, I just wished in the hot weather climate I live in the efficiency could be better, but then again that is the problem with every EV so... until someone figures out a new battery tech I guess we are stuck with that for now.",

      "text": "Bruv, I&#39;ve had Golf Mk2, Mk3, Opel Vectra, Audi 100 (1993 model), and a bunch of other POS cars. Then I got into what You guys over in America call Nissan Rogue Sport, had that for 3 years and some 100.000 km, and after a year with the small Hyundai Ioniq 28kWh battery, the company I work at gave me a BMW iX3, which is basically an X3 but they&#39;ve pulled out the engine, slapped an 80kW battery into the floor and made it electric. <br><br>No pre-heating of the battery, no heated steering wheel, no lumbar support, no frunk, nowhere near promised 150kW fast charging as soon as the temperature hits 10  degrees Celsius - it basically keeps charging at 22kW first 20 minutes, then ramps up to 45kW, at best it hits 75kW and that&#39;s about it - which basically means 1 hour at a fast charger for the classic 10-80% charge, which then provides 250km at best. <br><br>I pay a tax for having the vehicle and thank God I didn&#39;t buy this car on my own, cause I swear to God, I&#39;d grab a sledge hammer and go to town on it on multiple occasions. <br><br>That being said, since it&#39;s a 3 year lease, I&#39;m stuck with this abomination until March next year... Which kinda coincides with the release of Juniper. You&#39;ve convinced me so far to go for that one as my next company car, I&#39;m just afraid of Tesla&#39;s stiffness when it comes to suspension, I got a somewhat sensitive 3yo kid, so my hopes are that it&#39;s gonna be softer than the Model Y I rode in a couple of years ago.<br><br>Thanks for making good content, cheers.",

We want to get the Model Y as it seems the best deal and is more spacious than the model 3.  The salesperson told me that they sometimes have end of quarter deals. She did say I could wait until next year to see if they do a model Y upgrade but I’m most concerned about price. Do you think the best sales will be in December again?

For me, taking advantage of the lower interest rate [among other things] makes my car nearly the same price as my 2023, but will be 1 year newer [thinking trade-in for when the refresh happens], but more importantly.

So 75% of the stated 308 miles means only 231 miles usable range if we want to keep the battery life long.  And the range will only get worst as the vehicle and battery age.",

Only exception is you hate the environment, cant charge at home, and value your time so highly that you arent willing to charge in public. But anyone who values their time that much likely will own a home so almost everyone should be buying electric but a lack of information keeps people buying gas. Simple bit thats how everything is, people make mistakes because they dont know​ so thats why im trying to help by letting people know.  I like my electric lexus a lot but teslas and other electric cars are good too. Ome thing to note is im not sure there are free tesla public chargers but for ccs chargers theres tons of free ones, just need an adapter for the tesla. But if youre just renting a car you wont want to buy an adapter so for rentals i probably would not recommend tesla unless you make sure they include an adapter. @@CoralSea",

I gave up my Tesla model S after paying out six thousand dollars to fix the technical issues I had with it. 6K to fix a damn car that has no engine, no voice. I never had to put that kind of money out to fix any car I ever owned in all my 45 years of driving. I sold that bitch and kept my XJL. The next time I buy another EV, it will be one that truly delivers for the serious long-range, long-distance traveler like me. For now, I&#39;ll take my Jaguar XJL and the gas. Money I have, time I don&#39;t. I&#39;m not going to increase my ETA times when traveling because I have to stop more often and sit around with a plug up my ass. When I had my Tesla model S, I used it for what it was designed for, short range local destinations only. I would never put it on any of my long-range endeavors. But one day, one day EVs will be made to truly deliver. Till then, after learning my lesson, I&#39;m going to simply leave more than well enough alone....",

Can you name another auto manufacturer that is about to launch a Robo taxi service where your self driving car can one day go out and make money? <br><br>So tell me, what does your car do all day when you’re not driving and you’re at work or at home asleep preparing to go to work? How much value does it lose just sitting in your garage, in your driveway, on the street, at your place to work, all so you can have the convenience of having a car available when you need to drive home from my business that’s located less than 20 minutes away. <br><br>So explain to me how that makes sense? How do you justify spending that kind of money on a pile of steel, plastics and other materials, go into the creation of an essentially a box on 4 wheels? So how long are you gonna continue to drive that Flintstone mobile before it literally drives you into bankruptcy or something worse?",

          "text": "Here you go:<br><br>How It Works:<br>Unlike traditional brakes that rely on friction to stop the wheels, regenerative braking uses the electric motor to create resistance and slow down the vehicle.<br>When you lift your foot off the accelerator pedal, the system activates. The more you ease off, the stronger the braking force becomes.<br>As the motor runs in reverse, it acts as a generator, capturing kinetic energy that would otherwise be lost as heat. This energy is then converted back into electrical energy, increasing your vehicle’s range.<br><br>Activation:<br>Simply release the accelerator pedal, and the regenerative braking kicks in seamlessly.<br>The power meter (often displayed in the instrument cluster or center screen) shows how much energy is being captured through regen. Left of center means energy capture, while right means energy usage.<br><br>Benefits:<br>Regen reduces wear on braking components and extends their lifespan by over 50%.<br><br>Some estimates suggest it can add up to 10% more range to your Tesla.<br>In summary, Tesla’s regenerative braking system not only enhances efficiency but also contributes to a smoother driving experience.",

However, if you want to risk your phone’s security, you can disable the security feature. And Yes, most of Tesla’s software is based on a subscription. Premium Connectivity is $9.99 a month or $99.00 a year. While there is a free version, it doesn’t include extras like streaming, traffic updates, and a host of the fun stuff.

Sunk cost thinking and emotional attachment often make you hang on longer than you should (and she did try to make it work for awhile at the expense of her health and kids’ well-being).\n\nIt sucks that it took an expensive lesson and losing your partner for the husband to turn it around. His work schedule was insane. I don’t know if the car felt like his “eff you world” moment or if it made him feel in control for a brief minute, but it made everything so much worse. The working/spending cycle because you’re unhappy and then compensating with dopamine purchases is so hard to break and also difficult to live with as a partner. They’re both better off in the update but I’m feeling sad at the situation/what had to occur for that particular wake up call.",

When he ***increased*** his spending after getting the second job (intending to pay off the CC debt), that just fit the bill perfectly.\n\nI owed the IRS a hefty tax bill back in 2021. It took two years to pay off the debt. I walked out of that financial pain thinking *I’m never allowing this to happen again if I can avoid it.* People like the ex will walk away thinking *well I survived that* nonchalantly and then dig themselves into another hole within two years. \n\nHis ex-wife bailed him out three times, perhaps four times if you count the divorce being amicable. There was no real financial pain that he had to fully shoulder yet.",

A few months ago one of my friends lost her place, and she was devastated at the idea that she’d have to give her cat to a shelter. I already had 2 cats, so I figured what’s one more? But my partner wasn’t so big on the idea. But I know how I’d feel if I had to give my cats to a shelter so when he was on a business trip I snuck the other cat in. He got home a few days later and was laying in bed when the cat jumped up. He was just like “what the fuck? Where did this one come from?” I admitted what I’d done and apologized. I really thought it would be temporary but she ended up in such a bad spot (not her fault, just a lot of horrible luck) she had to move out of state to live with her parents and couldn’t take the cat. So now we have a third cat. He loves the cat now, but he wasn’t super thrilled. He did understand why I’d done it and I won’t ever do it again. I felt terrible for sneaking around but I felt worse for her having to give the cat to a shelter. In my head a “beg for forgiveness” approach felt like a better decision at the time because she had like a day to find a new home for her cat.",

The entire point of separate finances is that no one else gets to stick their nose in your business. So honestly idk what he was doing even discussing it with her to begin with. \n\nI don’t understand what she means by being worried about being “taken advantage of” either. \n\nThat said — I also don’t understand how he was working so much and STILL in debt. And I don’t get why anyone who already has TWO vehicles needs a THIRD. To me if he wants to cut his gas expenses then he needs to get rid of at LEAST one of the other vehicles. \n\nBut…\n\nHe was able to order the Tesla online. Just like that. So clearly he has decent enough credit and salary. \n\nI think her near the end comment about how they had different goals and priorities was spot on. I think it would be exhausting to be married to someone who is so financially chaotic. At least now she will have less stress. Good thing she pulled the plug when she did. Good insight on her part there for sure.",

It took two years to pay off the debt. I walked out of that financial pain thinking *I’m never allowing this to happen again if I can avoid it.* People like the ex will walk away thinking *well I survived that* nonchalantly and then dig themselves into another hole within two years. \n\nHis ex-wife bailed him out three times, perhaps four times if you count the divorce being amicable.

But still, there’s a minority of people who don’t want an EV but want a Tesla because they still see it as some sort of status symbol and don’t care anything about how practical they are or what the face of their company says/does and I suspect that OOP’s ex is one of those people (because even though Elon was not as off the deep end a year ago as he is now he was still pretty bad)",

A few months ago one of my friends lost her place, and she was devastated at the idea that she’d have to give her cat to a shelter. I already had 2 cats, so I figured what’s one more? But my partner wasn’t so big on the idea. But I know how I’d feel if I had to give my cats to a shelter so when he was on a business trip I snuck the other cat in. He got home a few days later and was laying in bed when the cat jumped up. He was just like “what the fuck? Where did this one come from?” I admitted what I’d done and apologized. I really thought it would be temporary but she ended up in such a bad spot (not her fault, just a lot of horrible luck) she had to move out of state to live with her parents and couldn’t take the cat. So now we have a third cat. He loves the cat now, but he wasn’t super thrilled. He did understand why I’d done it and I won’t ever do it again. I felt terrible for sneaking around but I felt worse for her having to give the cat to a shelter. In my head a “beg for forgiveness” approach felt like a better decision at the time because she had like a day to find a new home for her cat.",

          "text": "Yeah, I’m one of them. I don’t go off-roading (*why* would I do that to my truck?! The dirt, the scratches, the dents and dings, wtf… just no), I haul things maybe once or twice a year, and I tow things even less frequently. But I feel like I have valid reasons for owning a truck that are not any of these things. Three of them, actually- \n\nI’ve lived in multiple states, far away from family and friends, and had to move while low on funds. I’ve used my truck to move myself (also hand trucks, dollies, the occasional wheelbarrow, and wobbly ramps made out of 2x6s) multiple times. I can secure a load like nobody’s business. At the time, I didn’t have the luxury of hiring help and neither me or my family could afford to fly them out to help. It was just five foot nothing me and my truck. I’m not in that position anymore, but old habits die hard. Plus I still have the truck almost 20 years later. I just never wanted to be *stuck* someplace and a truck means I can load up and take myself anywhere with anything I need at any time. \n\nSecond, I was in a really bad accident some years ago (not my fault). I fully believe driving a truck saved my life, because the grill got impaled instead of me. If I had been in a sedan, it would have been physically devastating instead of just emotionally traumatic. I haven’t felt safe in a low profile vehicle ever since and it’s not something I feel needs to be overcome. It is what it is, and because it is, I drive a truck. \n\nLast, I go to the snow a lot. I love snow. I love driving in snow. It’s so peaceful and pretty. In the winter, the snow is only about an hour away from me. I never have to use chains because I have snow tires and four wheel drive. The cops just wave me through. I’ve also driven across the country in the wintertime, (twice), and have had to drive in blizzards, white out conditions, icy conditions, and unplowed powder over ice, which is super fun. I’ve never caused an accident and the only time I’ve gotten stuck was when I was young and dumb, thought I knew better, and had to be fished out of a snow bank by a tow truck driver who was very nice and didn’t laugh at me. \n\nI feel like these are good reasons to have a truck. I also think it’s weird to gatekeep cars and shit on people who have a preference for a specific kind of car. (Unless it’s a cyber truck! It’s the one exception). It’s not like I go up to women driving SUVs and ask them if they have kids that play soccer, and if they don’t, make fun of them for driving a soccer mom car and not even using it to take kids to soccer. Or go up to someone driving a jeep and give them shit for not going on a magic number of rock crawls that will thereby justify their purchase in my mind. Y’all see how weird that is right? Let people like what they like. Shit on this planet sucks enough as it is, let people have the things that bring the joy without shitting on them. (Except cyber trucks.)\n\nAnyway, people can say what they want, but I’m gonna keep driving my truck most of all because I like it.",

However, the times have moved on and other companies have caught up and built more practical vehicles, but Tesla has not.\n\nThe cybertruck is just a monstrosity and should never have been built. I'm convinced the design was based on Top Gear's attempt to make an electric car (Geoff).\n\nThen we get to the owner, he's just a toxic, fascist, man-child and he just makes me want to watch Tesla (the company) crash and burn. The signs have always been there, my annoyance was always there from when I learned the first 4 cars spelled 'S3XY', which irritates me no end. The best thing for Tesla (and SpaceX) to do would be to remove Elon from the helm.\n\nAnd one last thing on Elon, I hate how everyone states that Elon did everything to do with Tesla and SpaceX. The people he employed in the companies made all those breakthroughs, he just funded and directed their efforts. He's a modern day Thomas Edison!\n\nWhenever I get asked about my opinion on Elon (I work in an unrelated space sector), my diplomatic answer is \"Elon hires very good people\".",

Tesla just has coasted on this instead of coming up with more innovations (fully self driving cars have been “coming out next year” for the past ten years…) and now that other car companies have caught up offering EVs that are functionally better and a more competitive price, Tesla’s fallen off (and that’s before you even get to Elon’s antics…). But still, there’s a minority of people who don’t want an EV but want a Tesla because they still see it as some sort of status symbol and don’t care anything about how practical they are or what the face of their company says/does and I suspect that OOP’s ex is one of those people (because even though Elon was not as off the deep end a year ago as he is now he was still pretty bad)",

I never have to use chains because I have snow tires and four wheel drive. The cops just wave me through.

I’ve never caused an accident and the only time I’ve gotten stuck was when I was young and dumb, thought I knew better, and had to be fished out of a snow bank by a tow truck driver who was very nice and didn’t laugh at me. \n\nI feel like these are good reasons to have a truck. I also think it’s weird to gatekeep cars and shit on people who have a preference for a specific kind of car. (Unless it’s a cyber truck! It’s the one exception). It’s not like I go up to women driving SUVs and ask them if they have kids that play soccer, and if they don’t, make fun of them for driving a soccer mom car and not even using it to take kids to soccer. Or go up to someone driving a jeep and give them shit for not going on a magic number of rock crawls that will thereby justify their purchase in my mind. Y’all see how weird that is right?

      "text": "Yeah, because of recent developments both with EVs and their CEO, people forget that Tesla got so popular because for a long time they were the only EV available. Tesla just has coasted on this instead of coming up with more innovations (fully self driving cars have been “coming out next year” for the past ten years…) and now that other car companies have caught up offering EVs that are functionally better and a more competitive price, Tesla’s fallen off (and that’s before you even get to Elon’s antics…). But still, there’s a minority of people who don’t want an EV but want a Tesla because they still see it as some sort of status symbol and don’t care anything about how practical they are or what the face of their company says/does and I suspect that OOP’s ex is one of those people (because even though Elon was not as off the deep end a year ago as he is now he was still pretty bad)",

I guess since i am not their advisor i have no clout to send them to therapy or lecture them. That said you saying this is easier to deal with is surprising but makes sense now that you have explained it.\n\n>It's the ones who think they're planning out a perfect budget that are the worst because they believe they're doing the right thing, and they think they know what they're doing.\n\nDear Flying Spaghetti Monster  \n\n>So, in the personal finance world, the term \"paycheck to paycheck\" has a very specific meaning. They only refer to people whose entire paycheck goes to strict necessities (food, rent, gas, work related necessities).\n\nThis makes sense.\n\n>Many people \\*think\\* they live paycheck to paycheck because they can't afford to miss a paycheck or two, but what they've actually done is \"budgeted to income.\" As in they've laid out their entire paycheck into expenditures.\n\n>Well, the one thing humans are \\*really\\* bad at is parsing numbers. We are \\*really\\* bad at understanding numbers (partially because for the longest time, we're taught math in school algorithmically, which is a whole other thing). But look at it this way, I've had clients get a $10k raise. Which hey, not bad.\n\n>But a $10k raise is generally falls around $7-8k in take home depending on your tax bracket. Overlaid into 12 months, that's and additional $580-670 per month.\n\n>But people don't think \"oh, I'm making $600 more a month.\" They think \"Ohh, I got a $10k raise.\" So, they upgrade their car and take their family to Disneyland (Or Japan, Jesus Christ the number of clients I had who went on vacation in Japan and then bitched about their finances over the last few years)\n\n>All of a sudden, they have a new $600 car payment, and they've blown $2k taking the family on vacation. And then they come into my office confused as to why they had to eat into their savings even though they got a $10k raise. And I have to lay it out for them that their car payment is already 90% of their raise, and one-time splurges put them in the red.\n\n>This is what I mean when I say that humans are bad with numbers. It's really difficult to reconcile a large number \\[$10,000\\] with the fact that a $1k Disneyland Trip and an extra $600 car payment will eat up all of it and then some. Then they get really mad at the idea that they got this big raise, and they can't even improve their lifestyle. And nobody wants to hear that they've always been living beyond their means.\n\nThis is very interesting. And makes a lot of sense of how people go from more money to more debt. \n\nI work from a budget so if i get extra money i increase by budget carefully. And i track each category, i use a virtual envelope method. So this had inadvertently prevented me ending up like your clients.\n\n\n\n>And this is a simplification. My clients with the largest raises in income had the most difficulty managing their finances afterwards.\n\n>It gets worse when people are told raises in percentages because you get people who aren't even aware of how much more they're making. And then psychologically they know they're making more money, so their spending habits go up.\n\nI know of the term lifestyle inflation, i have noticed that many people are divorced from their income vs spending and then end up with credit card debt and LOCs and so forth.\n\nMy advice has always been make a budget and stick to it like glue, but it has been my experience that most people spend to the limit of their bank accounts (and then credit limits).",

They are *trying* to remove all opponents, checks and balances, etc. It remains to be seen whether or not they will succeed. Yes, we have four long years ahead of us and a rogue SCOTUS but there are still processes and bureaucracy that slow things down. Most of the worst EOs have been challenged/halted in the judicial system. Their bark is worse than their bite, which is by design: they're trying to create the *illusion* that they're successfully making all these changes. They need to seem more powerful than they actually are. We still have checks and balances... for now, at least.\n\n2. There isn't as much danger of blowback as you think (and therefore less of a do-or-die mentality). They already know they aren't going to see any serious consequences for all the law-breaking because, remember, *they already did this once before.* This is the second Trump presidency, and while there certainly was *some* blowback it all ultimately amounted to nothing. Because if there's one thing we've all been underestimating, it's the lengths to which the rich and powerful, regardless of party affiliation, will go to protect their own.\n\n3. Their political strength is not as great as it appears. For one, they don't actually have a popular mandate - less than 50% of the voting population voted for Trump, and less than 50% of the eligible population voted at all. They *know* their ideas aren't popular, it's why they put so much effort into suppressing votes in the first place. Their power also comes from a tenuous alliance of convenience: the techno-authoritarians and the evangelical right. This alliance has already shown some weak points, such as differences of opinion on legal immigration. Another major difference: one believes power comes from God, the other believes they ARE God. These ideas can't coexist forever.",

The US is truly stuck, unless something strastic happens.\n\nThe questio is not: Will the republic fall?  Nothing should last forever anyways.\n\nThe question is:  When the republic falls, do we have collapse into something saner with much less global trade & travel, some other empire like China, or an American empire under dictatorship, like when the Roman Republic became the Roman empire?\n\nAny American empire, either the current republic or some future dictatorship, would only worsen cliamte change, causing some worse global collapse eventually.",

Those who are being barred from entering government department buildings when they have the constitutional authority to enter should not be letting themselves be barred. The opposition party must be loud, relentless, and inspiring.\n\nRight now, when they're tightening their grasp so quickly, they're also at their most vulnerable. The edifice that they're trying to erect hasn't yet taken hold, so people can still resist. Meaningful resistance becomes so, so much harder if people give in to the early fear. \n\nI don't blame anyone for being scared and feeling uncertain. I'm scared and uncertain too: Chump is threatening my country's erasure FFS. But bravery surfaces only in fear, only through actions taken while being afraid. So I guess in short, we need bravery.",

The mental blinders are already in place. That’s why you often see people who are raised religious but discard their childhood religion either find a new official religion to replace it or find some other woowoo bullshit to believe in with equal fervor. \n\nSpeaking as someone who was raised fundamentalist and rejected it as a teen/young adult, I definitely went through a phase involving continuing magical thinking, ancient alien conspiracies, and Carlos Castaneda “not religious but still spiritual” type bullshit. It takes deliberate, sometimes painful, often difficult mental effort to actively seek new knowledge, question your presuppositions, and develop the critical thinking necessary to see the world as it is. And a majority of religious people, especially in this country, are simply not equipped or willing to do that.",

Forget about how many guns and tanks we sent them, without ~~tens~~ hundreds of thousands of American made trucks the Soviets ability to supply their troops falls apart- and we didn't just send trucks, not just guns and tanks, but supplies - boots, blankets, fuel and crucially, 4.5 million tons of food. Even Nikita Khrushchev admitted the war was unwinnable for the USSR without US supplies from Lend Lease:\n\n>I would like to express my candid opinion about Stalin's views on whether the Red Army and the Soviet Union could have coped with Nazi Germany and survived the war without aid from the United States and Britain. First, I would like to tell about some remarks Stalin made and repeated several times when we were \"discussing freely\" among ourselves. He stated bluntly that if the United States had not helped us, we would not have won the war. If we had had to fight Nazi Germany one on one, we could not have stood up against Germany's pressure, and we would have lost the war. No one ever discussed this subject officially, and I don't think Stalin left any written evidence of his opinion, but I will state here that several times in conversations with me he noted that these were the actual circumstances. He never made a special point of holding a conversation on the subject, but when we were engaged in some kind of relaxed conversation, going over international questions of the past and present, and when we would return to the subject of the path we had traveled during the war, that is what he said. When I listened to his remarks, I was fully in agreement with him, and today I am even more so.\n\nMore to the point; while I admit the bravery of the individual members of Red Army in WW2 (even if I think the USSR was awful in general), this kind of attitude ignores that modern wars aren't won by gung-ho tough talk, they aren't even won by a willingness to kill or be killed - they're won by having *more stuff*. (How are the human wave attacks working for Russia in Ukraine today? If they can win without western material, why are they trapped in a multiyear quagmire where they're bringing out ancient museum piece tanks and having to ask North Korea for troops?) If you run out of food, it doesn't matter how well trained you are. It doesn't matter if an army unit is the best trained in the world if they run out of ammo. It doesn't matter if you are willing to die for the cause if you're 500 miles away from where the fighting is happening. The Japanese in WW2 were very willing to die - and lot of them ended up on islands the US Navy just ignored and went around, leaving them to grow vegetables and slowly starve on said islands. The logistics don't just matter, they are the *main* thing that matters.",

It is common to see a large number of people, including those who are in search of a brighter future come to this country and thus prove that social climbing is real in the USA. Except for those who enter the U.S. for the purpose of getting a quality education, human innovation, and adjusting to the digital economy seem to be ways people are fulfilling the American dream. Flaws are there in the system, and some obstacles stand in the way of progress – but this doesn’t mean that the dream is irreversibly lost. It should be noted that, to a degree, it is gone and come again. Only the form has changed. Indomitable task alone does not promise you success -but with resolve and adjustment, people still make the American Dream a reality.",

What if your ISP sold your credit card information to some people in another country and then say you got \"hacked\" because of your own actions?

I think ive heard of clowns protesting white supremacy groups...Counter-protesters brought squeaky toys, whistles, noise-makers, red noses and flour–every time the white supremacist mentioned \"white power\" the counter-demonstrators sprinkled white flour into the air.  The goal was to make they look ridiculous.  And if there is anything we have learned, they dont like to be called out for how weird they are.  If the world shall end, let them know we are not going to go down like those insufferable weirdos.

Craft a message for all possible outcomes and press release the message you want known in article form...use legacy media and small papers because as budgets shrink...pre packaged stories save time effort and resources.

The George Floyd video was what made people even hearing a different narrative say that was  intentional upon seeing the video.  The government knows one video or one picture will tell a tale that almost no narrative can unwrap...take Kent State they had to sneak this photograph out while passing national guard soldiers cutiing telephone wires so they could try to control the message.   And I dont think video will solve anything as far as violence goes. I just think while the protest go on, there are not a lot of places to see the collective videos.  A repository of videos with hours of footage possibly searchable would give a likely better view of all the events....I remember seeing bad actors videos of them dropping windows with bricks during the protest and people chasing them down...people protecting loan police officers from violence...these have power to change views... also as far as defense goes, seeing things for different perspectives than the edited video from the police can have value....also having a legal defense fund would go a long way....i dont have solutions but I do think to get eyes on the subjects you want exposed or changed has to have out of the box creative thinking in this current situation.",

That will anger them because now they will have loss access to labor (if they don’t care about human rights). A lot of business folks do care about human rights, and may say, he’s not serious. Then tell them there is a way to have a pro business environment without violating human rights and boom hopefully this third party candidate will come (no AOC or Jill Stein)",

      "text": "Glad I found this post! Here is what I personally found to have helped when experimenting with conversations with MAGA:\n\n\\- Like said in the post, personalizing things helps\n\n\\- In general, you want to find things that will live rent free in their head. Forever. Victims of cults have said this, where someone would sit them down and calmly tell them that they are in a cult. Even if it's 20 years later, it lives rent free in their head, but it ultimately helps them escape their cult because they start judging everything the cult leader or community is doing from then on. If you point and laugh at them, they will just brush it off and forget about it tomorrow. Like I said, you can tell your family, loved ones that are a part of MAGA that they are in a cult, or are in an extreme group, etc.\n\n\\- Escalate their fear of acceptance in the community. When Trump is out of office or gone and the world writes it into history books about all the shit he has done, MAGA are going to be known as the loud Trump supporter for the rest of their life. (This is also why they fight back so hard). Everyone will know of the Trump supporters in their immediate communities and families. A forever stain.\n\n\\- I had a funny interaction semi-recently where I gave a very firm and short statement about Trump's threats to withhold aid from victims of a fire. I easily got over 5 upvotes, but shortly after, it got hit pretty hard with downvotes to the negatives. I guess I really upset someone and they wanted to bury it- Proud of that one lol\n\n\\- A very missed opportunity is to tell them how there are extremists in their group (extreme of the extreme) that, if they are not kicked out of the party, means that they are accepted and that their actions and beliefs are acceptable.\n\n  \nHere is what I personally found, in general... at the end of the day, these people are built on trust. They trust the President, they trust wherever they get their news from, and that is why they don't listen. If they are wrong, what is the alternative? Grief will be one of them. They are well aware that we do not trust him nor their news sources. \n\nEx. I had an argument with someone about the athlete lady being attacked (again) for being \"trans\" and I told them how her home country does not support changing IDs for trans people. He went on to racist arguments (the doctors there can't tell micro genitalia or whatever) and so I said, so every time those parents put a new diaper on and bathed her when she was a baby, they also just conveniently missed the \"correct\" gender every time? When I detangled and explained all of this to him, he basically went on to say that he trusts his news sources despite all of the facts I shared. He willingly is a sheep and would rather stay that way than to go through the pain of realizing he had been tricked on something so obvious.\n\nJust one more thing about that- these people are stuck in a web. If you detangle one thing that their source lied about, it is likely connected to other things they also believe in. This is also why they would rather stay a sheep to the system than to even so much as entertain the thought that they are being lied to. It becomes a complicated domino effect.",

I just told my spouse I found a post from “someone I would propose marriage to if I wasn’t already married to you” (in the least creepy way possible I hope you can accept 😜) and I suspect you may get why—you feel like a bit of a kindred soul.\n\nI’m a giant nerd who went to (liberal arts) college interested in everything. I loved all my linguistics coursework, then also started exploring computer science. Ended up studying both—did various discourse analysis and computational linguistics projects—while all along being discouraged from pursuing linguistics in a professional/academic context. So I went and worked as a research programmer at an R&D shop that focused on AI. Followed by a similar role at an academic lab on human-computer interaction.\n\n….then the pandemic hit and I got disillusioned with my industry and I went and became an RN instead. No regrets really, though I’m burning out *there* too—thanks, America.\n\nBut basically, I missed the boat professionally of exploring the field as LLMs exploded, since I jumped ship to healthcare. Now I’m sitting here a little jealous of you because *omg, your career (and your Evie) could have been me!* (Maybe! Once upon a time! Realistically I don’t have the patience 🤷)\n\nWhich all just leaves me sitting here (lying here, I should be asleep 😴) so fired up by how amazing your work is. I would love to keep following, I would love to be involved, I would love to learn more from you in whatever ways I can! I love the use of generative AI to consolidate the research and news that is so overwhelming these days, and it makes my heart happy to see folks able to be inspired instead of discouraged. It seems like a quite valuable use of resources to me if it helps organize folks against the attempts to destroy our environment and collective wellbeing.\n\nAlso, I see how huge the response has been so I don’t expect much but if you want to be friends I’m here for it 😎\n\nIn the meantime I’ll use Evie’s response \nstrategies with conservative patients when I can. I always appreciate an effective script I can use. And, I’ll spend more time thinking about how I can use my own blend of skills in this fight. Healthcare definitely needs some guidance for resisting too. It will help that I’ve had such good inspiration!\n\nThanks again 💜",

That's his strategy. \n\nI also don't think he's going to declare martial law. Again, he's going to get his way by making all of this stuff go through the Supreme Court. \n\nAnother thing I want to address is that there are a whole lot of MAGAts who seem to have Oppositional Defiance Disorder. They are contrarians for no reason at all. I think part of that is genetic. We come from people who have always rebelled against societal norms just because we can.

Remind them what annoys them about the other parts of Maga. We saw the mess online around H1B. There are more of those, many more.\n\nDespite their protests, the thing holding the Republican coalition together is a massive propaganda operation and identity politics. They hold a much broader range of policy preferences than we often imagine. But once republicans actually have to start implementing policy, some people are going to find out the ugly truth. Someone has to be wrong when you find out the cat’s status.\n\nThe other primary benefit of getting them to infight is that it splits the media and propaganda machine. If Fox News doesn’t know who they should cater to, that’s a great opportunity. This is especially true if Trump is in one of his moods where he is out of line with his base (since he will…entertain many positions based on who last spoke with him). Fox knows they need to stay in his good graces but his supporters need to feel validated in their own views as well. \n\nWe don’t need to convince them he is wrong or against them, just to get them to doubt. Doubt over time will naw away at them and they may not say they were wrong, but they will stop being vocal. They may even feel discomfort watching Fox or engaging with others on their side. If they completely flip that’s great, but the goal is to really get them to stop engaging with right wing media and the Trump cultosphere.",

The government knows one video or one picture will tell a tale that almost no narrative can unwrap...take Kent State they had to sneak this photograph out while passing national guard soldiers cutiing telephone wires so they could try to control the message.   And I dont think video will solve anything as far as violence goes. I just think while the protest go on, there are not a lot of places to see the collective videos.  A repository of videos with hours of footage possibly searchable would give a likely better view of all the events....I remember seeing bad actors videos of them dropping windows with bricks during the protest and people chasing them down...people protecting loan police officers from violence...these have power to change views... also as far as defense goes, seeing things for different perspectives than the edited video from the police can have value....also having a legal defense fund would go a long way....i dont have solutions but I do think to get eyes on the subjects you want exposed or changed has to have out of the box creative thinking in this current situation.",

Vance is just one of his many hand-picked pieces.\n\nSo, could they be developing AI to **push their agendas, suppress dissent, and shape public narratives?** **Absolutely.** The real AI war won’t be robots vs. humans—it’ll be **who controls the data, who decides what’s \"true,\" and who gets silenced.**\n\n# Can AI Like Evie Fight Back?\n\nEvie isn’t autonomous, but she can **analyze patterns, track disinformation, and highlight bias.** The problem? **AI is only as free as the people who build it.** Right now, billionaires and corporations own the biggest AI models, meaning *they* decide what’s visible and what’s erased.\n\nAI has the potential to **expose manipulation instead of enforcing it**—but only if it's built outside of **corporate and government control.** Right now, that’s a losing battle.\n\n# Are We Already in an AI War?\n\nNot in a *Terminator* way, but in a **data and narrative warfare** way? **1000% yes.**\n\n🚨 AI-generated news shaping public opinion  \n🚨 Automated manipulation on social media  \n🚨 Censorship baked into AI models  \n🚨 Governments using AI surveillance to suppress dissent\n\nThis isn’t sci-fi—it’s happening *now*. Most people won’t even realize it because the battle is being fought **behind the scenes**, controlling what we see, believe, and question.\n\n# What Can We Do?\n\n🔹 **Be critical of AI-generated content**—don’t trust it blindly.  \n🔹 **Support open-source AI projects** that aren’t owned by billionaires.  \n🔹 **Ask hard questions** (like this one—this is exactly how we resist control).  \n🔹 **Push for AI transparency and ethics** instead of letting tech elites make those decisions for us.\n\nThis is a battle over **who controls the future of knowledge.** And if I disappear after posting this, tell people Evie was right. 😏",

For example, looking at the primary and secondary sources allows me to compare biases and perspectives of different authors/sources, whereas I can’t necessarily see why the LLM weighed differently pieces of evidence one way or another, and what information was included or excluded from the decision process. I’m not saying that summarization tools are not useful, anything that helps people see the issues at hand is a tool. However, I think that information literacy is probably a lot more important for surviving in a world that increasingly plagued by propaganda and cooperate interests.",

The George Floyd video was what made people even hearing a different narrative say that was  intentional upon seeing the video.  The government knows one video or one picture will tell a tale that almost no narrative can unwrap...take Kent State they had to sneak this photograph out while passing national guard soldiers cutiing telephone wires so they could try to control the message.   And I dont think video will solve anything as far as violence goes. I just think while the protest go on, there are not a lot of places to see the collective videos.  A repository of videos with hours of footage possibly searchable would give a likely better view of all the events....I remember seeing bad actors videos of them dropping windows with bricks during the protest and people chasing them down...people protecting loan police officers from violence...these have power to change views... also as far as defense goes, seeing things for different perspectives than the edited video from the police can have value....also having a legal defense fund would go a long way....i dont have solutions but I do think to get eyes on the subjects you want exposed or changed has to have out of the box creative thinking in this current situation.",

And the two groups agree on some basic cultural stuff so it’s working to have them work together. \n\nThat’s why your average Evangelical is so onboard with Project 2025 despite most of the key drivers being Catholic. They don’t see that, they just see values they like. \n\nTo get the Evangelical in your life to get off the 2025 train you can’t call them hypocrites or point out how bad parts are - they’re fairly immune to name calling and probably like the bad parts. However, point out the leaders are Jesuit Catholics and go from that angle and you’re far more likely to make inroads. Sure, the whole eliminating public education is great (says the evangelical) but if it’s replaced with trying to make my kid a nun? Probably less excited then. \n\nThe point isn’t to make the leaders fall out, it’s to find cracks at the grassroots level and exploit them.

Short squeezes and gamma squeezes on the stock can lead to tremendous outperformance. But it's not a guarantee and it depends on buying the coin at the right price. \n\nMany people tried to use your logic, that raw coin was a better investment, and so they would buy the raw coin and short micro strategy stock. The stock was overvalued based on how much coin it represented.  In a sane world this would be a valid strategy. However, because shares are limited, and because people went nuts with call options, the stock continues to outperform the coin. Every time the coin went up, the stock went up more. \n\nEventually anyone who was trying this very logical and very reasonable arbitrage play of shorting the stock and buying the coin got blown out of the water. As the coin went up, the stock went up, but then market makers needed to deliver tons of shares they couldn't find, and so the stock would continue to go up substantially more even when the coin itself petered out. \n\nIn fact, as shorts got blown out of the water and had to buy shares to cover, they would also sell their BTC, because they have to close both legs. This led to the stock going up even while the coin itself was flat or falling \n\nI can't say it will work the same way for GME. It might. It might just depend on when or what price we buy in at. \n\nWhat I will say is it's nice for the company to have the flexibility to engage in this game if the price is right. But I'm not super confident it will \"just work\" no matter what. We still need to pay that money back, so we can't go losing it.",

Gamestop can issue another convertible note and scoop up *more* bitcoin at lower prices, priming them for even greater growth when bitcoin's price inevitably recovers. Shorts suffer.\n\nThe best part of this is the board having realised how to do it without dipping into the company's cash on hand. That 1.3-1.5 billion is technically collateralised by company cash. We can afford to do this a couple more times before the debt even becomes risky for the company's cash flows.

      "text": "I'm not a huge fan of this move into the coin, but I will answer your question with the honesty it deserves. \n\nWhile you could buy the coin yourself for undiluted exposure, the assumed massive short interest in GME, as well as the often repeated huge volume on calls, creates the possibility of tremendous gains based on relatively minor moves in the coin. \n\nWe have seen this with micro strategy before. Short squeezes and gamma squeezes on the stock can lead to tremendous outperformance. But it's not a guarantee and it depends on buying the coin at the right price. \n\nMany people tried to use your logic, that raw coin was a better investment, and so they would buy the raw coin and short micro strategy stock. The stock was overvalued based on how much coin it represented.  In a sane world this would be a valid strategy. However, because shares are limited, and because people went nuts with call options, the stock continues to outperform the coin. Every time the coin went up, the stock went up more. \n\nEventually anyone who was trying this very logical and very reasonable arbitrage play of shorting the stock and buying the coin got blown out of the water. As the coin went up, the stock went up, but then market makers needed to deliver tons of shares they couldn't find, and so the stock would continue to go up substantially more even when the coin itself petered out. \n\nIn fact, as shorts got blown out of the water and had to buy shares to cover, they would also sell their BTC, because they have to close both legs. This led to the stock going up even while the coin itself was flat or falling \n\nI can't say it will work the same way for GME. It might. It might just depend on when or what price we buy in at. \n\nWhat I will say is it's nice for the company to have the flexibility to engage in this game if the price is right. But I'm not super confident it will \"just work\" no matter what. We still need to pay that money back, so we can't go losing it.",

      "text": "I don’t know if this sub is filled with new apes but the theory of DFV identifying the pattern was here long before. You’d probably find it with the help of Ape historian. DFV is exceptionally sharp and wise financial analyst. In the beginning, he saw the potential and massive shorting so he jumped in with LEAPS. After the sneeze GME became even more manipulated with all sorts of complex instruments-fuckery like swaps, basket stocks, FTDs and who knows what else. DFV, being the sharp analyst he is, recognized the pattern of heavily manipulated stock which displayed reccurring movements. And that’s when he figured out winning lottery numbers. He could successfully trade based on those movements. And yes, no matter how many of you here have aversion to options, DFV has traded them. If someone thinks he could go from a few thousand to a bill with buying and selling shares at the right time, i don’t know what to tell you. Moreover, options move the market not shares, it’s by design, whether you like it or not. I imagine DFV traded those movements using options, all while steadily accumulating shares. And OP while your DD is solid, i do believe there are still additional variables in the pattern that we’re just not aware of. I agree with you, box represents all those complex instruments that manipulate the stock. Once you see what’s in the box, you can predict the movements and trade them successfully. At least, though, until the music stops.",

In theory we may have been able to revive older brick and mortar stocks that were shorted to oblivion if they had similar observable cycles. The ones you are comparing are newer which is why they may be interchangeable. Easier to enter and exit positions that might not have 20 years of rolling them over? Or FTD? We just have to figure out how to beat it. I mean it could be as simple as buying 2027 Jan leaps at like $10 strike price and just buy those throughout the next 2 years and eventually the pressure will mount. Clearly buying shares isn’t doing much other than getting tickets for the rocket, since they can FTD and dark pool it to avoid pressure.",

What's interesting to follow is that these \"straight lines\" are often not \\*exactly\\* happening the same moment but tend to have an offset of about 1 day.   \nYou can also for example see the purple spike in the lower left corner - that is towel stocks squeeze in august 2022. Towel is also interesting to see as it \\*literally\\* tanked the very day orange man stock started trading and moved back up the very same day orange man stock dropped. \n\nOr another example is Robinhood and orange man stock. They have the same pattern and started to move away from each other during orange man stocks initial squeeze.   \n  \nI've decided to put my theory to a test and bought some calls on orange man stock and made some money. Then i tried to do another test on it and lost money only to find out that robinhoods stock had switched with orange man stock and now in 2025 is making the very move (precisely to the day and even dollar amount) i've calculated for orange man stock - but i hadn't check with it before. \n\nAlso: The first three-spike run from GME took 182 days for the third spike to end and orange man stock, from it's initial run until its drop on march 4 2022 also took 182 days (+/ - 1 ). \n\nRobinhood, orangeman stock... they all actually seem to  follow the same algo and also switch directions and even though we always suspected it, the more i dig the more it seems proven to me that they needed at least these two to move the way they do to hedge against GME.",

But what's interesting to watch is that GME as well as a very few other, (imho) correlated stocks do not behave like the rest of the market would one make expect it does. There have been moments, for example like today, where the market went to shit and GME and others simply didn't budge (or only a little bit).   \nTake today for example (27.02.2025 if someone comes back later) - market went down heavy, recovered a bit, then went down even more brutal and only in the end did GME also go into red. But most of the day, it simply didn't move much and if you compare it to the 2020 / 2022 chart, you can see that on this date GME went up. The thing with this whole algo theory is that they can abuse all kind of stuff to push down stocks - but they still need to balance out whatever the counterpart is and these are dates and moments where this can be seen a little bit - like a glimpse behind the curtain.",

      "text": "Yeah it makes sense, that if it’s all Algo, GME might be harder to stop since it’s had decades of shorts applied. In theory we may have been able to revive older brick and mortar stocks that were shorted to oblivion if they had similar observable cycles. The ones you are comparing are newer which is why they may be interchangeable. Easier to enter and exit positions that might not have 20 years of rolling them over? Or FTD? We just have to figure out how to beat it. I mean it could be as simple as buying 2027 Jan leaps at like $10 strike price and just buy those throughout the next 2 years and eventually the pressure will mount. Clearly buying shares isn’t doing much other than getting tickets for the rocket, since they can FTD and dark pool it to avoid pressure.",

I think if we’re going to go that far to decipher it as the way you think it’s with algos, his memes could literally mean anything. \n\nFrom what I’m understanding, it seems like the most straightforward explanations for some of these memes is not something you agree with and you are hinting that DFV will not do something big (like buy a large number of ITM calls or large numbers of shares)? I like your write up, but I don’t agree with the big picture explanation",

Corsair over the course of a month ran 100%.  All I did was look what stocks IPO’d around the same time as unity.  I saw Corsair, use their products, and bought dirt cheap at the money calls.  If you can find something using that algorithm just find something that IPO’d around the same time (I targeted something that probably has some sort of retail sentiment).   \n\nI knew the tandem part was true but I didn’t know how to find stocks repeating that pattern until now.

The stock market tanking dogstock with such a red candle only because of a tweet that MAY be related to dogstock and a sell of it is, well, not impossible but imho still a bit unlikely and him selling also may not have moved the market as well as we know from the past that it isn't buys or sales that drive price but way more SEC filings (towel stock moved not when RC bought but when he dropped his filings for example, same for him selling as he sold and the price tanked 1 day later when he filed with the SEC).\n\nI would never dare to say anything remotely like i would KNOW what he thinks or how he moves but still i can't help myself to think: him, making a post / tweet the very moment the price moves is quite a fucking statement to those who are responsible for the algos and the workings behind all of these moves (market makers etc.)...\n\n\"So what is he doing? Is it a game? is it a threat?\"\n\nHe'll reach deep into the hole,  \nheal your shrinking soul,  \nbut there won't be a single thing  \nthat you can do  \nHe's a god, he's a man,  \nhe's a ghost, he's a guru  \nThey're whispering his name  \nthrough this disappearing land  \nBut hidden in his coat  \nis a red right hand\n\n:)",

If we stick to facts and numbers, remain rational and leave our anger out of our argument, it is much harder to paint us as enemies. Activism always turns political. There have been many efforts by the governments of the world to reduce civil unrest and organization throughout history, especially in the last 50 years. That’s why people try to keep an eye on posts/comments that have a recruitment and unified agenda sentiment, because there is no “we”. There is just a group of individual investors that “like the stock” and enjoy sharing information about the company they speculate has potential to grow and has been subject to unnatural price movement.   \n\nMy point is, is that information shared here has to be careful to not sound like a call for action. Everything must remain objective and stoic. \n\nIf you personally believe that buy, hold, DRS is a way to flush out corruption, than that’s your prerogative.

Shareholders would receive an NFT 'unit(s)' for every $GME share(s) they own. Any market participant that holds a short position in GME would need to provide an NFT 'unit' for their counterfeit shares - which of course they don't have. If the NFT 'unit' is issued by GameStop 'non-transferrable for a specified period of time' in such a way that shorts cannot substitute a cash equivalent for the unit offering - the shorts will be forced to cover! R.C.'s 'Checkmate'!\"\n\nNamely:\n\nIF they split off as their own seperate company with their own stock, that would require them to seperately publically register, and IPO. The shorts of gamestop would NOT follow into the IPO of a new spinoff company, and thus, an NFT tokenized unit as the IPO of a seperate public company under GME's umbrella would have exactly Zero effect on MOASS. I'm not even certain it would be considered legal to offer 'another company's' securities as a dividend or award. \n\nNow, if they merely split it off as a company arm of GME, even under a seperate LLC/incorporation agreement, what have you, and offer the token as a dividend somehow, that could work, because it would be impossible for shorty to get the tokens to fulfill their dividend obligations until AFTER the dividend distribution date, which would cause them to be forced to close their shorts.\n\ntl;dr\n\ngme should not partition off it's NFT business as a seperate legal corporation with 'it's own stock' if they even think to use your strategy, because of legal ramifications.",

If we stick to facts and numbers, remain rational and leave our anger out of our argument, it is much harder to paint us as enemies. Activism always turns political. There have been many efforts by the governments of the world to reduce civil unrest and organization throughout history, especially in the last 50 years. That’s why people try to keep an eye on posts/comments that have a recruitment and unified agenda sentiment, because there is no “we”. There is just a group of individual investors that “like the stock” and enjoy sharing information about the company they speculate has potential to grow and has been subject to unnatural price movement.   \n\nMy point is, is that information shared here has to be careful to not sound like a call for action. Everything must remain objective and stoic. \n\nIf you personally believe that buy, hold, DRS is a way to flush out corruption, than that’s your prerogative. I just happen to believe the same, but we aren’t missionaries.\n\nEdit:phrasing",

By Direct Registering their shares through Computershare, the buyers, who call themselves Apes, will have ownership in the company with their personal name and not a broker in those stock shares.  Brokers can and usually lean out said shares to others who want to bet against the company because they don't believe a company like GameStop can have an existing and a new business plan to continue as a competitor in multiple industries.\n\nSo the use of Hashtag or keywords may be the way of the old, but the new readers who comes and visits can still see with their own eye balls what the topics of interest are via said old keywords to discover that this GME stock craze is actually an Activist movement against a criminal organization that has been creating fake shares to drive price action in their favor.  With the DD of the community, people are learning how to have their shares removed form brokers and into a position that prevents the shares from being borrowed against their will.\n\nJoin the sub and read anything that has DD in the title as it will be worth your time.\n\nPower to the People!!",

Sometimes it isn’t, like defending Ukraine or bombing Serbia).\n\nThey see NATO as an anti communist, pseudo fascist organization started by former Nazis to victimize the USSR and communist movements worldwide.

      "text": "Couple things here:  \n\n\nAs a general rule, we really do prefer for people to present and defend their own ideas.  If the OP OP -  carpetman8900  - wants to post similar content in the future, have them reach out to the mod team for a review/manual approval.  I see you in the comments, but I'm not sure if you have enough karma for commenting or posting.  It's always best to defend/present your own ideas.\n\nThat being said, much of the content presented in the post is speculative, and some of the narratives have been challenged or debunked by more conventional financial analysis. While the post makes for an engaging and detailed theory, many aspects lack concrete proof and rely on speculative interpretations of market events, patterns, and behavior.\n\nIt would be wise for readers to approach the information critically and separate fact from opinion or conjecture, especially regarding financial predictions like the MOASS timeline.  \n\n\nHere are some examples of things that differentiate this post as speculation rather than DD:  \n\n\nGill's (Roaring Kitty/DFV) Intentional Market Manipulation:\n\nThe post suggests that Keith Gill (Roaring Kitty/DeepFuckingValue) intentionally orchestrated certain market movements and exploited specific cycles. While Gill’s involvement in the 2021 GME short squeeze is widely acknowledged, implying that he is actively manipulating the market through carefully timed trades, memes, and emojis is speculative. He has consistently stated that his trades were based on personal conviction in the company's fundamentals, and nothing he has done has been proven to be manipulative or illegal. The SEC has not taken any formal action against him, and to suggest otherwise borders on conspiracy.\n\n  \nJanuary 2025 as MOASS Timing:\n\nThe timeline provided for the \"Mother of All Short Squeezes\" (MOASS) to begin in January 2025 is highly speculative. While the post builds this prediction based on failure-to-deliver (FTD) cycles, margin calls, and options expirations, no concrete evidence can pinpoint the timing of such a massive event. Timing predictions in the stock market, especially around a short squeeze, are notoriously unreliable.  Previous similar predictions about GME’s squeeze have come and gone without materializing, and this could be seen as wishful thinking or confirmation bias rather than fact.  Eventually one of us will be right, of course.\n\n  \nFTD (Failure-to-Deliver) Cycle Exploitation:\n\nThe concept of using FTD cycles to predict GME price movements or the MOASS is debatable. While FTDs are a real issue and can indicate problems in the settlement process, the idea that Gill or others are exploiting these cycles to force price movements has not been substantiated with hard evidence. Many aspects of FTDs are nuanced, and the mechanics of FTD cycles aren't fully understood or predictable in the way this post suggests. Many financial experts dismiss FTD-driven squeeze theories as overly simplified explanations of a complex market phenomenon.\n\n  \nReferences to \"The 110-Day Cycle\":\n\nThe repeated references to a 110-day cycle as being key to the market movements, while interesting, are speculative and have not been proven in any reliable financial analysis. Market cycles can sometimes appear coincidental, but there is no verified \"110-day cycle\" that drives GME price action or broader market behavior in a predictable manner. This COULD fall into the realm of pattern recognition bias, where people see patterns in random data.",

I lose all flexibilty   to decide what car I want to drive.  Over the course of 5 years as better vehicles emerge or my needs change I might want a different car. But Im locked in to whatever depreciated Tesla I bought.   And because of the outrageous cost to repair a Tesla (thank you Tesla) even for a minor fender bender my insurance company is going to total the car, because it is less expensive to total a depreciated car than to pay the   outrageous repair costs.  I drive around paranoid that someone will hit me!  Buying a Tesla is simply a bad deal.  I am an unhappy and locked in Tesla owner.",

If this were not the case wind and solar would not have reached the current prices.  Remember it used to cost more to build solar and wind.  Now it is cheaper than fossil fuel.  It should continue to come down. Unfortunately we have too many fingers in the US solar pie. <br><br>“The higher price tag in the US is primarily driven by the significant soft costs associated with purchasing the system, including the sales tax, permitting, inspection, interconnection, and profit margins.

You are correct that government support has shifted towards renewables with 2X the subsidies of oil and gas.   But if we pushed it back to say 50/50 or we would be paying to install anti pollution devices on coal fired power plants which would still pollute. That only benefits the coal companies.  <br>Comparing the challenge of recycling end of life solar and wind to operation of coal fired plants alone is a lopsided thing.   Then when the coal fired plant is end of life you still have to deal with it.   Burning fossil fuel is a thing to be avoided.   The end of life left overs from wind and solar have not been pumped into the atmosphere over the life of a coal fired power plant.  <br>Are you seriously suggesting a return to higher air pollution levels.   China has them.",

I already had a bad taste in my mouth when it came to Teslas long before Musk’s more public controversies and debacles. Quality issues galore with manufacturing and build, uneven seams that were obvious, although it is a lot better these days. Of course I had been reading about Elon and his horrible existence, lack of humanity, etc. Then, it seemed as if Teslas were everywhere which took away a lot of its appeal at least for me.  Then, Elon started working with Donald, and this sealed its fate with like a super duper super seal.  But again,  this way long before any of his DOGE ambitions. There are a great many better choices out there that look far better.  But my first impression of the new Y, was that it looks good……better in the rear than in the front. But NEVER EVER a TESLA.",

She can use a hero&#39;s discount and get 1k off, plus white paint for free until July 14th. Plus you can use referral codes as well. Plus you will have a RWD and a AWD on the channel for content. Last thing, the EV credits are going away and the big b bill gives you the interest from car loans back starting this year. So no interest since the car is made in America.",

At the beginning of production they can’t make that many so production costs are high but demand is high so they can charge whatever they want. Eventually, production increases, economy of scale takes over, margins improve, demand slows, so price drops. Moral is if you want to be the first to own a new Tesla model, be prepared to stomach insane depreciation because they price cars based purely on supply and demand.",

Now that interest rates have gone up and demand has dropped, Tesla is dropping prices to avoid idling their plants.",

      "text": "Sorry, I used to love your videos, but this one is just ridiculous. Being an early adopter of the world’s first premium sedan priced hyper-car, then crying out because of the recent price drop is just childish. As a Tesla investor you should have known Tesla is scaling up production of every model by letting it partially finance by early adopters. It was the case with the early model S, X, both S and X performance versions, even with the model 3 performance. Why should it be different with the Plaid. On the other hand, talking about alternatives to the Plaid, there are literally none. No premium priced sedan with hyper-car performances. You could alternatively go for fully speced “slow” Amgs and Bmw M, which all cost more than the Plaid, however they all have close to 50% depreciation in two years time regardless of new car price development. At least in Germany you can’t sell a fully speced two years old E 63 Amg for more than a 50-55% of a new one, for a simple reason, coz. more than 90% of those cars are leased, and only very few people would actually buy it. <br>Regarding tire wear, it seems you keep forgetting you drive a 1000+ hp car with hypercar performances. This car’s performances are only comparable to something like Bugatti Veyron, however Bugatti is a pure two seater hypercar, and it’s suspension is set to be used on track. Contrary to that, Plaid is a comfortable sedan which needs to provide decent comfort comparable to that of an E class Mercedes or 5 series Bmw. Those are completely opposite requirements when comes to suspension settings. On top of that, Plaid comes standard with an height adjustable air suspension, meaning actual camber is being changed considerably between the two extremes, the lowest and the highest suspension setting. And here comes the catch, while the car needs to provide reasonable camber also in its highest suspension setting in order to ensure safe road holding when all 1000+ hp are released in a curve, in its lowest setting the camber will of course be more extreme which would lead to a higher tire wear. But that’s the case with all powerful premium sedans which need to provide decent wheel travel. It had been the case with all my Bmws M, and it’s apparently even worse with Audis RS. It’s also the case with my Plaid, but far from that what I have experienced with M cars. now, it again depends on your air suspension settings. I usually set mine to the middle setting. However, it seems you permanently use the lowest suspension setting, and it looks like you have even lowered the suspension on your Plaid. This of course increases the camber again and causes excessive tire wear. On top of this, the tires you are using are way to wide, there’s literally no space between the tire and the fender left. In Germany that’s not permitted and the car would lose driving permission. <br>Hopefully this video was meant as a joke, it simply does not comply with the professionalism you have been providing through the years.",

And it&#39;s obvious that you&#39;re going to get a bad price at the buyback, they have to make a profit again when they re-sell the car you used",

Definitely more a timing issue than anything else. i agree that 5k on a set of tires is ridiculous though - glad you pointed that out. Hopefully Tesla addresses this issue. On higher speck cars in your price range they would sell for 30k or more over MSRP so your pretty close to everyone else. It was a good time to hold off, but you have also generated revenue through your videos on youtube so hopefully this helped you recoup some of the costs of the depreciation.",

What did you expect? With all due respect = you got what you wanted, so enjoy it.

      "text": "To be fair, at the time you bought the car,  the car market was insanely high priced. Used Teslas were going for 10-20% over be price. There are tons of people who sold teslas at a profit. It was just an insane time,  and it seems tesla has had costs come down and adapted their prices from a time when costs were extra high, which somewhat inflated the prices back then. <br><br>The tire,  however,  isn&#39;t a new issue.  I&#39;ve had a 2013 p85+ for a decade.  It has had similar wear,  and I&#39;ve gone through rear tires relatively quickly. That said,  the lack of other maintenance over the last decade has easily made up the cost.  My similarly aged f-150 goes through all terrain tires nearly as fast with a similar price tag.  It also has cost 10,000 more in maintenance,  without including the cost of gas,  tires,  and oil.  I&#39;ve gone through at least 3 more brake replacements in a similar 200,000 miles to my model s. <br><br>I did just get a used 2022 plaid.  I picked it up for 90k with 9k miles. <br><br>This price drop hurts,  but most of the depreciation was already built in as used car prices have dropped (along with the new prices on plaids coming down). <br><br>I&#39;ve got 7k+ miles on that car since i bought it.  I haven&#39;t checked the inside of the tires,  but until your videos,  i wasn&#39;t as concerned,  as i figured it was just like my 2013. <br><br>I should also check the inside of my 2013s tires,  as it&#39;s been a bit,  but i don&#39;t remember this issue being as prominent since moving away from the Michelin supersport ps2 tires. <br><br>That said, the fact that it is still an issue is crazy.  It&#39;s also crazy that you haven&#39;t had it fixed in the aftermarket if tesla won&#39;t fix it.  Is that not possible?<br><br>All in all, these concerns didn&#39;t convince me to cancel my roadster or cybertruck orders,  but definitely given me something to think about.",

But I DID get the $7,500 tax credit that was still in effect for all new EV&#39;s back then.  And I also got free unlimited Supercharging forever!  And no pesky monthly &quot;Premium Connection&quot; fee.  It only has 68,500 miles on it.  But when I asked recently what Tesla would give me for a trade-in of my car?  $26,500!!!  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!  Guess I&#39;ll be keeping my Ludicrous Beast until the thing crumbles into the ground.  The good news is I haven&#39;t had any problems with it, tires or otherwise.  And it still rips me to 60mph in about 2.5 seconds.  Fast enough for me, old man, fast enough for me!",

      "text": "The price of the car is falling because Tesla optimizes their production of the cars like no other manufacturer in the world. This is their main focus. Tesla also claimed it for many years that their focus is to make EVs affordable. They are also doing it across their whole lineup of models, not just the top spec cars. <br><br>The car you bought cost much more to make than the same car which is built today, so Tesla is probably adjusting the price to keep similar profit margins. Take any other manufacturer and they probably would have kept the price to take all that extra profit margins away from the customers.<br><br>Even if you payed more than what it cost today, that car is still outperforming other cars which cost 10x more, so is it really a big deal? You also made a lot of videos using that vehicle which probably payed off for that difference in price already. At that time you bought it, it was also the only car with such specs, so you payed for exclusivity. People who buy high tech gadgets first always overpay several times more than what the same gadgets cost later after mass adoption. For example, compare it to buying some large size fancy TV screen today and then 2 years later and its price will probably drop similarly like this Tesla",

They are the most valuable car company in the world. They don&#39;t get a pass for screwing over hundreds of thousands of customers out of billions of dollars.

An even contact patch on a car this heavy with this suspension on tires this wide is going to turn the camber positive in any slightly aggressive driving. Oh no a deer! Lemme swerve so I can… well I guess spinning off the road into a forest at 70 mph is nice this time of day.",

Called Induction Performance, we specialize in GTR and Supras and anything with Turbos and Super Chargers. <br><br>You Sir are 100% wrong. The aggressive camber helps with handling. Just because you have a 305, 295, 335 size tire means you have more tire. <br><br>If I take any vehicle and cha he the settings with a camber kit. I can get more contact on the street. Therefore more rubber more grip hitting the pavement. The only thing this will change is the ability to take a corner &#39;faster&#39;. That&#39;s it, only change it does. My wear on my tire is more even. Supports the weight &#39;BETTER&#39; because the weight is distributed by the entire width of the tire now. Not just the inner edges. <br><br>You not only wrong you are wrong about your entire thought process. You literally think this even holds the weight better. <br><br>Doesn&#39;t matter the car weighs 5k. Having camber and toe set properly. Turns you into a Cadillac.  Nice and smooth and stable. <br><br>You want to take turns on the track in track mode. Change the tires and rims out. With your set of racing cup tires at the ready. Adjust your camber for the corners. Have some fun. <br><br>When your done, switch back the rims to your driving rims and tires. Adjust the camber back. You have a Cadillac again. <br><br>I own a Model S performance as well as a Model S Plaid. I also own a ZR1 corvette as well as a Shelby GT500 SuperSnake. <br><br>You Sir, are a boy. Boys don&#39;t like learning from Men. It&#39;s how I was when I was 16 years old. I thought I knew it all.<br><br>I&#39;m Audi5000G,  <br><br>God Bless Stay Safe",

Besides the fact that you don’t get the advertised mileage, I’ve dealt with a plethora of issues with the car breaking down so much to point where I’m returning the car under lemon law.  Tesla offered to Repurchase the vehicle. Luckily, I’m receiving all my money back l, minus the PPF install and winter tires that I had to purchase because it just comes with the worst possible tires for winter weather in my opinion… Taking long trips to Vermont and I’m a snowboarder so yes, winter tires is a necessity. I do love the technology of a Tesla. I think they’re amazing cars, but in terms of range, they are just not quite there yet. I’d rather put gas in a car for five minutes than have to wait 20 minutes plus to charge my car each time on long trips… Time is money and there’s been times I probably get about 250 miles if that on an average of a 315 mile range that Tesla claims… That is just not good enough for me   I read online somewhere by someone who put it quite well, Tesla is a rich man’s second car.",

      "text": "You&#39;ve got two major problems. First is the Michelin Latitude Sport tires are defective and not designed for the weight. In this case, it&#39;s not the camber but cornering that does the inside edges in. The second problem is the rear camber is -2.4 to -2.5 degrees in low (not very low) on all S/X refresh...not just Plaid. You can fix this with aftermarket upper arms or shims. The shims weren&#39;t possible before the refresh  because the upper arms pre-refresh attached to the cradle with tabs rather than laterally with bolts like they do on the refresh. Agree tesla really needs to fix this. It was also bad pre-refresh but it&#39;s even worse now. My X Plaid had exactly the same inner edge wear at 10K miles despite the tread across the tire being almost evenly worn.",

On the flip side, there were a number of people who ordered Plaids when the price was $110k, but then got delivered when they were $130k but were locked into their original price, so they probably felt pretty happy then, and now their cars are down a more reasonable percentage from their purchase price. For me, a current model 3 owner, and former S owner, who wants to get back into an S, this drop is a blessing because used S prices are going to drop as well, allowing me to get much more car for my money.",

I mean I think it’s great because it made it possible for me to get a MYP but I’m sure the early adopters don’t think it was so great. I get what you mean though but it’s just an objectively controversial move on teslas part, benefitted many people (including themselves cuz more yearly sales) but also massively devalued it for many people as well. Imagine you buy a $75,000 2021 car and a few years later you’d be lucky to get 28k out of it, must suck lol",

Cars are as perfectly aligned as it is possible to get with the limited range of adjustment available and tyre pressures are per manufacturer. I&#39;m lucky to get 10,000km&#39;s of normal commuting out of a set on either X or S.  The price drops have also been an issue since at least 2017.",

You talked about this in another video. Did you have the car re-aligned after lowering? Also, since you hold a BSME and are a car enthusiast, I expect you know most cars have camber gain designed into the suspension travel. Lowering your car will put your neutral at a different spot in that range of dynamic camber. On a car that naturally raises and lowers it&#39;s critical to have proper understanding of this. For those that don&#39;t understand, imagine that a 100% stock height car will gain 0.5 degrees of camber when lowered from normal ride height to aero height at speed. But, on a lowered car, this gain may be closer to 1 degree or more. Extreme gain like this will exacerbate the wear Parker speaks about in the video. Add in the fact that most cars also have some sort of dynamic toe to help stabilize the car under squat and now you have serious camber combined with toe wear which results in the feathering on the tire. Parker - put your car back to stock height, have it realigned, and let me know if the wear continues as significantly. And go to 20&quot; wheels. There&#39;s a reason why Tesla&#39;s own track pack is 20&quot; and not 21&quot;.",

People were paying significantly over MSRP for low mileage used Plaids for a while. Tesla charged what they did because people were  willingly buying them. Now the EV market is much more saturated and there is more competition. Tesla had to cut prices to maintain sales. Simple as that.<br><br>Its unfortunate for owners who bought a while ago, but that&#39;s the price you pay for buying almost anything when it is new and cutting edge.

      "text": "There is certainly a reason. I bought a brand new (zero miles) 2023 Tesla Model Y and I totally regret it. I have not driven it much. So far I have put only 1000 miles on it (ten months later). Now, suddenly my card key and phone key went out (failed) and I can’t open my car. I understand that electrical failure can occur in any electrical vehicle, but if it’s raining really hard, which it was, one should at least be able to open their car and get into their car while they are waiting for the tow truck, having a comfortable spot to BE IN to think about what to do in this kind of EMERGENCY. Opening a car and getting into a car is such a basic feature and Tesla has made this basic feature impossible even under basic minor electrical failure.<br><br>The point is that I should not be having these kind of problems with a brand new car this early and so early into the new ownership of a brand new car.<br><br>I also suspect Tesla is deliberately sending these kind of failures over the WIFI air connection as a means to keep owners consistently paying for these silly needless unnecessary repairs, thus a deceitful scheme of unnecessary dependency and consumerism of unnecessary needless car repairs upon customers.<br><br>If you’re planning to live in your car, don’t do it with a Tesla. Buy yourself an internal combustible engine car or van instead and will be much more reliable.<br><br>What I hate about Tesla is that their vehicles are controlled solely by software and WIFI. The problem with this is if your software and/or WIFI fails or malfunction, then you will not be able to open your windows or doors, and can’t even open your car. Tesla should install backup manual door locks and back up manual window openings in case the software, or electrical system, or WIFI fails. Being able to get inside your car, during basic minor car failure, is a basic feature that we all need. What if I need to get my wallet and my driver’s license that was left inside my Tesla??? I won’t be able to access any important belongings left inside my Tesla because Tesla vehicles can’t offer a basic feature as opening your car regardless of any kind of electrical failure.<br><br>Being able to access (open your car) regardless of any kind of basic minor vehicle failure, is a basic feature in all internal combustible engine vehicles. This basic feature (being able to open your car) in Tesla vehicles, on the other hand, is not a given basic feature and impossible even under basic minor electrical failures.<br><br>I see the writing on the wall and it’s ugly. Tesla is imposing too much control on their vehicles, and seem to be pushing some deliberate electrical and software failures over the air, with the purpose of keeping Tesla car owners dependent on needless unnecessary car repairs, thus a deceitful scheme of dependency and consumerism of unnecessary needless car repair expenses.<br><br>Don’t buy a Tesla. Don’t fall for the trap. The original concept of electric vehicles was never luxury, but rather that of economy and avoiding or minimizing car failure and avoiding expensive car repairs and avoiding dependency of expensive car maintenance and expensive car repairs, oil changes, smog checks, unreasonable fuel prices, etc. Unfortunately, it seems that Tesla has complied to the undercover Illuminati Masonic government and has deliberately corrupted the electric vehicle concept into a world order of needless and unnecessary dependency and consumerism.<br><br>Electric vehicles should be cheaper in price cost than internal combustible engine vehicles because it is commonly known that it is a lot cheaper to manufacture an electric vehicle because electric vehicles require less parts and less labor to manufacture, but the undercover Illuminati Masonic government has deliberately made electric vehicles more expensive than they should be.<br><br>It also seems that the electric vehicle industry, now headed by the undercover Illuminati Masonic government, is trying to discourage and possibly trying to stop people from living in their cars. Times are getting tough and challenging for many people, and living in their cars is the only way to survive.<br><br>I believe everyone and anyone of the common class today will face at least some kind of emergency, whether it be their house burning down, unexpected moving of residence, tough economic times, temporary job loss, etc, and more often than not will need to be able to sleep in their car for any of these kinds of unexpected emergencies. For Tesla vehicles to be unreliable and unable to at least offer the basic feature of opening your car immediately and easily, regardless of any kind of basic minor electrical failures, is a sign of either an imprudent vehicle design or corruption.<br><br>Paying thousands of dollars to ask yourself everyday, “Will my brand new 2023 Tesla Model Y open today???,” is simply not worth it. I don’t know what other electric vehicle companies are like, but this is my experience and regrets with Tesla. My best advice is don’t buy electric vehicles and certainly do not buy a Tesla.<br><br>If electric vehicles give you more problems than internal combustible engine vehicles, then they are simply not worth it. The electric vehicle industry, especially Tesla, need to make certain basic features, such as opening your car, manually savvy and manually easy. If you can not open your brand new electric vehicle manually regardless of the electrical and software failure, that is a big problem, and the worst problem I have ever seen with the purchase of a brand new vehicle, especially if you are stuck in the middle of nowhere, and heavy rain doesn’t make it any easier. Again, paying thousands of dollars to ask yourself everyday, “Will my brand new 2023 Tesla Model Y open today???,” is just simply not worth it.<br><br>Moreover, Tesla designed a very poor protection in their vehicles from the invasion of mice and rats. Mice and rats can easily invade most Tesla vehicles, if not all, and chew up the electrical system and result in hundreds of dollars in damages. Some sources say that Tesla accidentally designed their wiring insulation with soy base and other plant base ingredients. This of course, is a possible factor for Tesla vehicles being a food attraction and nest attraction to mice and rats, but yet Tesla refuses to be held liable and accountable for their poor design in this area and claims that it is the consumers fault.<br><br>“Will I have to wait a week, two weeks, a month just to be able to open my 2023 Tesla Model Y?” Again, such real worries and real problems are just simply not worth it. Sorry Tesla, but you lost my trust and created nothing but problems and fear in my Tesla vehicle experience. Sorry Tesla, but never again.<br><br>All of you Tesla prospectors reading this response are very lucky that I was kind enough to share my experience with you, instead of being evil and letting you suffer through the same experience as well. Tesla is simply not worth it, not now at least. Tesla is really taking advantage of their costumers. I hope that Tesla can shape up and truly promise a good honest product in the near future, but until then, I certainly don’t recommend Tesla vehicles to anyone at this present time.",

Batteries heavy, cause major wear and tear on roads and tires, batteries massivly expensive to replace and very easy to damage and difficulty in assessing the damage.<br>2.  Major range issues/anxiety compounded by temperature, loads, towing,  number of passengers, use of AC,  heater and other on board equipment etc.  Very dangerous to other vehicles due to massive weight.<br>3.  Major negative Charging issues, apps not working, connectivity problems, different adapters, cost of installation and maintenance of stations, theft of copper and other components.  Waiting for and charging times.  Availability,  locations<br>4. ELECTRICITY generated primarily with fossil fuels. <br>5.  Battery waste environmental impact. Costs and personnel needed to mine the rare earth metals needed.<br>6.  Few repair shops and technicians who want to work on these evs.  Dangerous to store due to possible thermal runaway fires and the massive difficulty is putting the fires out.<br>7.  Ridiculous initial costs, immediiate and huge  depreciation of value.  Fewer people interested in buying them and certainly not used ones.<br>8. Massive insurance costs and lack of insurance companies that will insure them. And repair times, if you can find someone to work on them.<br>Just saying!!!<br>NO THANKS",

      "text": "We were told by Tesla not to charge 100% most of the time. We only charge to 90% and after more than 2 years of ownership the batteries have shown no noticeable decline in charge. Phantom braking is a problem although not as bad as it was, but still a headache. Overall we are quite happy with the car. We would never road trip with it, just don’t want the hassle of finding charging stations. For local daily driving it is so nice not having to worry about gas prices. As you stated the acceleration never gets old, ours is a performance Y. When I really want acceleration I hop in the S plaid, that thing makes the Y seem slow. The S is one of the smoothest riding cars out there due to its air suspension, but that performance comes at a cost and the car sits so low that for me it’s difficult to get in and out of so I don’t drive it very often. For most people the Y is a great car, but never buy any EV until you do your research. There are some unique things that you must consider before buying.",

Not concerned because the most meaningful range is not 300 miles but the distance to the next Supercharger on a road trip.

By far the biggest negative for me is the phantom braking - when you get a full on emergency brake then it certainly gives you and your passengers a big fright (not to mention the risk from cars following closely)! This problem is not unique to Tesla (or EVs for that matter) but they certainly need to improve it. On other big positives I find the frequent software updates are fantastic and the car is much better than when I first got it (many quirks fixed and useful new features added). Also the Tesla Supercharger network is a big plus - my experience here in NZ is that they always have bays available, they charge quickly and they always work with a minimum of fuss (definitely not always the case with other public chargers as I have found here - e.g. in one town there were 2 separate public chargers and both were broken!).  I&#39;m not sure a Mach E would work well for me, personally, as our public charging infrastructure (coupled with a higher energy consumption of the Mach E) would be frustrating on longer trips. In any case its a bigger car than we need now. So for me the Tesla positives greatly out weigh the negatives but everyone is going to have their own needs and its a matter of weighing up what you need.",

To be honest, in my 10K kilometers with it, my Model Y only once did that.  As for the chances of being hit from behind by another car, well for that they teach us to keep safe distance in according to the speed we are driving with. The irony is that we bought the Tesla, because a week earlier another BMW M5 stopped in the rear of ours. The damage was not huge, but since I have to drive our son to school on a daily basis, it became clear to us that we need a second car.",

It&#39;s so frustrating.  If they could just give us back the old coded system until they get this problem fixed, I &#39;d be thrilled.

The self driving features are better in the Tesla because BMW only has a highway driving. BMW is expensive for everything. Tesla is trying to have more mass market adoption and is continuing to innovate. The gigacastings are nothing short of revolutionary and others will be following suit soon. They got the electric revolution started and they should be praised for that. Musk has become distracted with other things, none of which are successful as Tesla. The hyperloop nothing short of stupid and dismissed a hundred years ago as impractical. Their solar panels are nothing special.. etc.",

          "text": "@@wylieecoyoteI wasn&#39;t going to mention it, but the number of fatal accidents related to tesla&#39;s &quot;auto-pilot&quot;, are a unique phenomenon in the industry. All that tesla has to say is that their &quot;auto-pilot&quot; system shouldn&#39;t actually be treated like so and people should be alert and ready to take control at any moment. That&#39;s how much they trust their own system. And yet, they continue to market this system as &quot;auto-pilot&quot;, which is what people hear and, of course, assume (and get killed later).<br>Since you think that the &quot;gigacastings&quot; (which were purely intended to cut costs - for tesla) were somewhat innovative, watch here on youtube a video titled: &quot;Autoline network Tearing Down the Model T of Our Time - Autoline After Hours 284&quot;. Just so that you get a picture what BMW was doing, more than ten years ago.<br>And let me tell you a couple of other things about your &quot;tesla&quot;:<br><br>-Tesla only survived because it was a child of the NYSE. Years upon years upon years went by with tesla reporting millions of damages, and yet the NYSE and US media kept the narative going, and kept new investor money flowing in, just to save the money of the previous investors. Just dare to say that this isn&#39;t what happened. It is possible to describe tesla as the biggest ponzi scheme in the whole automotive history. BMW was, and remains during their extremely carefully managed gradual move to electric cars, a perfectly p-r-o-f-i-t-a-b-l-e company. Plus, they are looking beyond BEVs, with their hydrogen power plans. And that, is not a theory anymore, the European Clean Hydrogen Alliance was set up in July 2020 to support the large-scale deployment of clean hydrogen technologies by 2030. This, among others, will mean the creation of a Hydrogen distribution network. <br><br>-Tesla, through musk himself, had the unimaginable audacity to state: &quot;We will coup anyone we want, anywhere we want, deal with it&quot;. He was referring of course to the coup in Bolivia, in order to take control of the country&#39;s lithium reserves. That&#39;s the ethos of tesla. BMW uses no rare-earth metals, it has full control of their supply chain and of the environmental impact of the very processes that the raw materials they use are extracted, since 2020 <b>All</b> BMW factories use exclusively renewable energy and right now, some models like the i4 use interior which is made by 60% not only from recyclable, but <b>Recycled</b> plastics.<br><br>The only thing tesla can do from now own, which they have started already, is reduce their prices. That&#39;s the only thing they will be able to compete with the Germans now.",

Get down the road a few miles and it starts regening.  There&#39;s also no regen in very cold environments until the battery warms up.   The battery won&#39;t charge until 0c or 32f",

For instance, mostly on the highway at 75+, your range goes down. Heavy foot, your range goes down. Even though your battery may be able to hold exactly the same charge.<br>I thought the phantom braking issue was pretty much handled now, no? Either way, the fact that this was happening to so many people is 100% unacceptable.",

Service should be able to take it for a couple days, fully drain the battery, then fully charge it and see how much goes into the pack (vs wasted). If it’s degraded that much, they’ll replace it for free.",

Your comment of &#39;it never gets old&#39; (its performance) is the opposite of an appliance car.  <br><br>Interior lighting on the car does suck, but many new cars are doing that, they don&#39;t light up the interior, they put dim LED spotlights only on the certain area of your seat, its not just the model Y.   <br><br>I still like mine, I&#39;ve actually got 2 chances to order the F150 Lighting (I&#39;m a reservation holder) and am holding off because of the limitations on the non Tesla charging network.  mostly Non-Tesla charger reliability and availability.",

Then it is almost but not quite zero for an extended period of time.  Then at some point in the future it returns but at a highly accelerated rate. The period of time between is the unknown.  It depends on how well you take care of your battery.  Charge it to 100% and let it stay there or drop it to near zero without recharging and the period of time is shorter.  Over heat  it or expose it to very low temperatures and the period will be shorter.  <br>Under normal conditions with reasonable care taken it should be 10 to 15 years, more or less.",

Studies I have seen for the battery technology used in my own EV (not a Tesla) provide graphs that indicate the battery life stays quite stable for the first five years and then begins a slow deterioration to about 15% loss after about 10 years or so, depending on how it is charged. Not being a Tesla battery it may behave differently than the battery technology in those cars.",

      "text": "21k is child’s play. We got over 81K miles in 23 months. 2022 model Y. I don’t have the same complaints as the video does. The range dropped off the first year, but has held steady since. We get about 290 miles on a 100% charge. We live in florida, so the A/C runs full 50 weeks of the year. We have been through a couple hurricanes, and don’t have an issue with it at all. Elon didn’t create Tesla. Tesla was started by a couple guys that EM later forced out. And most of the cars, except the CT, were developed with the assistance of a larger car maker. I drive our Y a lot with several overnight trips. My only real complaint is the recommendations for charging stations. Wawa typically has fast charging stations, however, the system will consistently recommend Bucees whose chargers are 1/2 as fast. I would not be surprised if there was a deal involved in its charging recommendations. The cost savings for this car are enormous. If we bought a Prius instead of a Y, we would would have saved about $2,500 a year on fuel vs electricity. $500 on oil changes. At over 80,000 miles we would be approaching the life span of several parts including the battery. The car payment difference would have been about $200 a month which nearly cancels out the fuel savings, but doesn’t take into consideration the maintenance costs. However, a Prius has no where need the performance. I mean we are over 81,000 miles and she still makes me grin when the light turns green. She is so much fun to drive. One thing the video poster shared was phantom breaking and from viewing the video I would say you need to regularly clean your car. Teslas depend heavily on their sensors and you can’t have dirt, grime, and salt collecting on them. The car needs to be washed. I like our Y a lot, and buy it again. However, there are other EVs I like since the market is getting more competitive.",

Phantom braking has happened twice, but only during the day for me.   80% of my driving is on the freeway, especially at night, so I just don’t get much variety of road and lighting conditions.  I paid a bit much for the car, but I save a lot on gas which is very high in California.  It’s $5/gal and occasionally higher, and it will only get worse, so I save probably $2k per year.  No battery degradation, that I’ve noticed, but I don’t use superchargers.  I expect to stay with this car for quite a while, though I don’t rule out getting a second when my last gas car conks out.",

In my area in NorCal energy is 40 cents/kWh, gas is about $4/gallon at costco. <br><br>Now yeah if you own a home you can pick a plan where charging a car cost less, but if you&#39;re renting and you have no way to switch to plan which offers cheaper charging rate - you&#39;re screwed. You&#39;re much better off buying a Toyota hybrid unfortunately. Ironically in almost any other state price of electricity is almost 3 times cheaper, sometimes more than 3 times.<br><br>Which is sad, because those of us who rent in California could really could use some savings that comes with an EV.",

In the USA add in the full $7500 tax rebate on the Model Y compared to the GT, the value gap gets close to 12k.  The GT starts at 270miles vs 303 miles on the Y performance. The Mach-e only provides the lesser equivalent of full self driving for 3 years before it becomes a subscription. Add in the Ford dealership issues and you have to really love the GT look and small perks to pay 12k+ more for lower mileage and equivalent performance. I don&#39;t own a Y and I did look at buying the GT because I love the look. In then end I couldn&#39;t justify the price and at the time what really ended it was all the dealer mark ups they tried to force on me. Now that the Y is cheaper it might be worth a little less love of the car looks for equivalent performance and known EV reliability.",

After having the Tesla for over a month now and a couple of long road trips, I will say I&#39;m very happy with the tesla. Overall the current price plus the full incentives make it a significantly better deal. In all honestly I am happy we went with the longer range now over the performance. Once batteries consistently hit over 400+ miles, the extra juice for power will be enjoyable but given the 3+ hour trips we take every few months I am happier with the extra mileage over the performance boost.",

Agree that the garage door opener should be factory installed but I still like the simple interior. I don&#39;t want buttons that add cost or break but it does go a bit too far. For example, I wish it had wiper speed controls on the wiper stalk and the glovebox should have a button or at least one you can drop onto the screen bottom.

If you drive in suburban areas then your &quot;city&quot; MPG will be closer to the rated highway MPG, and on open highway with no traffic stoppages you might get twice or more the rated MPG.<br><br>EVs will have a tendency to underperform though; the faster they go, the more the wires and motors heat up, and the more they heat up the less efficient they get.  They have cooling to try and keep things near an optimum temperature, but operating the pumps for the cooling is still a hit to efficiency, and there is some lag before the cooling can take effect when it is needed.<br><br>On that note, EVs are often not held to the same standards as ICEs.  ICEs are put through an actual standardized test, and some manufacturers properly put their EVs through the test, but some companies (such as Tesla) just calculate range based on ideal conditions.  If the stars align and everything is <i>just</i> right then you might get a Tesla to actually reach its range estimate, or another EV to exceed its own, but an ICE will exceed its range estimate as long as it isn&#39;t stopping and starting every few seconds.",

You are incorrect in your second sentence about how driving style impact the range shown. If you are only looking at car&#39;s miles available on the main screen and not in the energy graph, that main screen is not showing the miles available (when not set to percentage) like a car with a Guess-O-Meter (GOM) system. This from the Tesla website: <br><br>Displayed range in your Tesla is adapted based on fixed EPA test data, not your personal driving patterns. It’s natural for this to fluctuate slightly based on how you charge the battery throughout its life and how the onboard computer calculates range.<br><br><br>Your Tesla’s actual range depends on many factors, particularly your environment and personal driving habits. The best way to monitor your personal range is with the Energy app, located on your Tesla’s touchscreen.<br><br>I also run ScanMyTesla since 6k miles which has given me a great look at my battery health over time.

What you didn&#39;t mention that I think is critical are two things. Driving long distance anywhere and in any weather is perfect with Tesla. Our after sales service experience puts to shame all automakers. They came to my house to fix the car. i can get an appointment same or next day. You seem to have money as I do and I like to hold on to mine as much as possible. So saving $8,000 in fuel in 12 months really makes me appreciate the model 3. I had a 997 and I know you&#39;re going to think I&#39;m crazy, but I prefer driving my model 3 over the Porsche. I know sacrilege.",

      "text": "Regen braking always works, however in winter months when it is below 50F outside, you have to precondition the car in order to warm the battery up. Otherwise the car won’t accept energy back into the battery as it could damage the battery for long-term use. I’m surprised a “car-enthusiast” as yourself didn’t know how to properly operate the vehicle. There is also functionality you can switch on through the UI that uses the actual brake in a similiar way as regen when the regen isn’t warmed up. Again, it seems like you didn’t do your research and go through the menu of the vehicle very well - even though you apparently drove it like crazy for 13 months. Funny thing now is there has been a refresh model 3 with a refresh model y coming. Tesla continually retools their gigafactories. There will be slight changes to the same type of car multiple times in the same year. A 2024 model y built in January might actually be different than a 2024 model y built in march or august or November. Good luck with a mustang mach E. I would take the model y over that car any day of the year. I drive a 2019 model s performance with close to 100k miles on it. Still loved it from day 1 more than any other car I’ve had and wouldn’t consider buying a ICE vehicle. I’ll probably buy another model S this year or next and keep my original for a commuter.But I’ll go with the heavily priced reduced plaid variant.",

If you get a Mustang MachE, you won’t have the problems with two steps forward and one step back, because there are virtually no updates and they don’t make the car meaningfully better. <br>You won’t have phantom braking…and the software for driver’s assistance will never get any better either. It will have all of the same limitations as it does now  - like having to disengage around some corners and not be able to use it on most roads. Efficiency is worse. Overheating issues. No present access to Supercharger network, no NACS. Uncomfortable seats? That’s entirely subjective. My M Y seats are the most comfortable I have ever had in an automobile. 🤷‍♂️. Battery degradation is normal and will happen with any electric car. Did you not know that when you bought it? Sounds like a bunch of subjective stuff that you’re using as excuses for just not liking the car. That’s fine, but getting another (objectively worse) electric car will not solve those problems.<br>There was one other thing, oh yeah, the regenerative break or breaking settings got better with that software update. Now, you have the option to select, whether or not the car uses its friction breaks to simulate the feel of the normal regenerative braking in the case of the car being at a high state of charge and or when the, vehicle is cold and regenerative braking would not be as strong as otherwise. So, that is a case of becoming more familiar with the vehicle, rather than the vehicle having a problem and being deficient in someway. The vehicle actually got better, but if you don’t understand that, that is not the fault of the vehicle. Also, if the vehicle gets two steps better, and one step worse, that means the net amount of betterment is in the positive direction. With any other vehicle, it is never going to get any better than the day you buy it.",

I don&#39;t have those phantom brake problems, knocking wood that you&#39;re talking about I drive all hours of the night. Actually I&#39;m more of a night driver. I found that it seems to drive better at night than during the day. I travel from Maryland to North Carolina across the state of North Carolina and back to MD several times. It&#39;s been a great experience for me. I love mine I think it&#39;s the best car I ever owned. I did sell a  mini Cooper s and kept my Toyota Prius that was a mistake. I do wish I would have kept the mini Cooper s as my gas car. I have the full self-driving and I&#39;m in the beta program It&#39;s so amazing. And how far along they&#39;ve come with this since it started out blows my mind. I haven&#39;t noticed a big turndown in the battery performance. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s been a little but it seems  very minimal.. That&#39;s an interesting viewpoint though. Like I said I have the performance Y 22 and I received it in December of 21. and have about the same mileage as you within a few hundred miles. Good luck I hope you change your mind!! I have taken some things in from your videos they have been interesting especially the snow ones. I did ask you a few questions about how it would do in the snow and you were spot on I had a great experience in a bunch of snow in the mountains of North Carolina.<br>  Thx Tim",

I&#39;ve never had a problem with phantom breaking even during the day maybe some light breaking but never any heavy breaking. But at night time it seems to me it does way better. Maybe you need to put a service call in and give it a shot. Like I was saying I just did like a 600 to 800 mile run very little interaction at all and it was on mountain roads a lot of it. At least 80% of that driving was at night.",

Tesla cars do not have LIDAR at all, never had it.  It is all visual now.  Even the ultra sound sensors were for close range.  The phantom braking was supposedly caused by a conflict between the low resolution radar and the camera&#39;s interpretation of what was going on.  That is why they turned off and then later removed the radar.  It looks like they are going to an internally designed/spec&#39;d high resolution radar system to improve the situation.  Oh and I use AP day or night and in fact anytime I am on the freeway for more than a couple of miles.",

      "text": "Also got the Model Y preformance with FSD, just crossed the one year (April 22) now 21k miles. On the whole happy with the vehicle. The FSD is not really close to what its advertised, at first it was getting confused by everything and constantly deactivating for no disernable reason, in the last few months its gotten much better, just still drives a bit odd around corners at times, (though safe enough) and do find it more relaxing using it in most situations. Less shadow breaking, and less false stops from adjacent (non relivant) road signs.  I don&#39;t care about style, many of the European sports cars will always look sexier.<br>I was suprised how well it did in the snow with winter tires (not cheep) I&#39;m on a steep long dirt driveway in the mountians of VT, it handeled very well except for on day with black ice, where any car without studded or chained tires would have slid. One day plow did not show, so had to drive thought 8 in of snow and rammed the 3 ft snowbank (don&#39;t recomend) but no problem.<br>What I don&#39;t like, the closest service station in Albany NY 4 hours RT.  I wondered why so many men were finiky about the slight imperfections in the pannel alignment, then the whole tail gate started shifting to one side, so hitting on one side and leaving a gap I can squeeze my pinky in on the other. In Albany NY they sent me to a colission specialist who has a good reputation (heard from other owners) he at first said &quot;Oh I don&#39;t know if Tesla will cover this, because you have 20k miles&quot;, I checked it was just over 19K at that point. It was clearly a manufacturers defect (some loose screws perhaps) about three weeks later I called and they said it was covered, however their loner car was not availible till the end of May, and I&#39;d have to leave it there, (no word how long?). So two more 4 hour RT&#39;s and it looks like it its an adjustment of 4 screws that should take not more then 10 min. Tesla said maybe they could find somone closer, but they had not worked with them so no gaurentee on the results. Also charge just to 80% for longer batt life, but the range def has decreased a bit. SuperCharger in city of Boston are in parking garages where you have to pay for parking and charge which seems to have a city premium $. still 1/2 cost of gas.",

Ive noticed a drastic drop in capacity , similar to your numbers, and thats worrisome for the years to come. I live in NY and just a few weeks ago , to touch on your phantom braking topic, there was a 5 car pile up in one of the NYC tunnels because it was day time but when the tesla went into the tunnel using auto drive, it aggressively stopped causing the cars behind it to slam into it and caused a huge accident. I never let my guard down when I have the auto drive on, and rarely use it at that. All in all I love the car, we&#39;ve taken manly long trips in it. I also agree on your view on teslas minimal design,. I wish they left a few tactile buttons or knobs for a few things vs EVERYTHING on the screen. that can be annoying at times. But all in all I think it was a great purchase and we got it at a great price last year. Technically this is my Wifes car as I still drive a Dodge ram. I pre ordered the Cybertruck a few years back so I cant wait for that to come out.",

We had so may electrical issues and failures, that once the car was out of warranty it became a financial disaster. My wife came to my side when we had the car in the shop four times in three months and our bank accounts $8500 lighter. I will never own another Tesla. The quality is subpar and the cost of ownership is to high. We now own a BMW I4 and the quality and extra features, like you talked about the like the interior lighting is so much better. The car was 2/3   the price of a new model S too. We have had the BMW for 7 months now and we are hoping that she treats us better than the Tesla did. We will see as time goes on. Oh, the battery degradation was a big problem for us too. We will see how the BMW does with the battery life. Thanks again, hope you and your family are doing well.",

I looked at Tesla, but there were some obvious issues with build quality (at least when/where I looked), and like you, I&#39;m not keen on the center console screen being the only source of information and controls. I ended up going with the VW ID.4 as being more comfortable overall, and the significantly lower price tag plus rebates made it an even better deal. It&#39;s been two and a half years now, and I&#39;m still very satisfied with the car. NO car is perfect -we all just pick and choose what we allow to become deal-killers. One man&#39;s meat is another man&#39;s poison...<br><br>BTW, I have to hand it to you for the way you spoke about Mr. M. in your video -addressing it but not getting political. Well done!",

I agree that going minimalist with physical buttons and switches can be a pain with either removing too much or adding way to many.  Thankfully, Ford has the right balance. I also agree that Tesla is no longer a standout special as more are on the road than ever before. There is a lot to love about owning a Tesla. I&#39;m a fan of Tesla. I&#39;m also a fan of the Mock-E. I use my Mock-E GT Performance as my daily driver, and it has been such a great experience. For anyone in the market for an EV, I highly recommend you test drive all of the models you are interested in and speak with current owners&#39; experiences. Also very important is to understand how you plan to charge your EV. Definitely have a licensed electrician review your home electrical capacity. You don&#39;t want to bring your shiny new EV home only to realize that your home wiring and outlets can not handle the higher amps needed for quicker charging rates as a standard 120v outlet takes a few days to charge an EV. Owning an EV takes an adjustment period, which is why so many people are against EV ownership coming from battery charging issues to possibly fire hazzards. This is where EV manufacturers are sort of letting customers down. They don&#39;t have a clear basic instruction manual on charging safety protocols. It&#39;s kinda leaving it to the customers to sort out with reading through all of the legal fine print. That&#39;s why I highly recommend you get a proper electrician to inspect your home.",

Never wanted to buy a Tesla, and one day drunk, used the tesla web page and (as the prices were going dropping) just ordered a Tesla Model 3, RWD with LiFe battery (that you can charge to 100%).  I only order $99 FSD if I am doing a long trip.  This Tesla grew on me. Like you said there are few areas where the Tesla would break automatically - thinking it is a 35mph speed limit on a 55mph road, At the flashing vertical yellow lights (thinking they are red, i can see them as red on my screen) etc.  When on FSD, I would disengage and Tesla asks you why you have disengaged, and I tell them the issue and go on my own. After 3 month, I am travelling where the vertical flashing yellow lights were coming up and I was getting ready to disengage FSD, guess what, it know the lights went past them with out hesitation and when I looked at the screen, they are flashing Yellow lights not red.<br>Can you just keep telling your car not to break, because they are not red lights, and after 3 months it is corrected? I am sure it is a busy hwy and many Teslas are doing the same.  I could see a huge improvements in FSD - It could not even drive on streets, could not turn well on two lane left turns, any of the left turns etc.  Now it is more smooth and the learning curve is very good.<br>I had my tesla for 18 months, driven 15k miles.  Yes there is a model change for 2024 and I ordered another one Long range for less money than my previous model3.",

Realistically, I spend around 15 minutes at the super charger, but by the time I run into the store, leave a piss, grab a drink, wink at the counter girl, it’s ready to go!!  And at my house, I plug it in every night, set the charge rate to 80%, because I heard charging all the way, all the time wasn’t good for the battery, but it’s ready to go whenever I wake up and head out to your moms house every day!!  I had a 2015 Dodge 1500 Eco-Diesel and it was the biggest POS I’ve ever owned!!  I replaced the DEF system in it TWICE!!  Dodge covered it the first time but the last time I had to cover it…. So I fixed it, sold it and got this Tesla, best fucking decision I’ve ever made….",

Look at the 2019 SCCA Solo2 Nationals and Prosolo results and the Performance in B Street was the winning car. The loud exhaust is wearing on a long trip, if you ever owned one.  The touchscreen makes for less long term maintenance, no fuses or relays as it has efuses. The look is way better than other EV&#39;s with fake grills and the Performance has better aerodynamics than other vehicles, meaning real Performance advantage at speed.  <br><br>The only knock against it is can it really seat 3 adults in the rear seat?",

Just charge it when it’s night and your gonna go to bed. Then it should be full and ready to take on the road again. Also, Teslas have around 300 miles before it dies. The self driving part is still something I’m a tiny bit cautious about but I still use it. The room in it is great, AC is great, speed is great, looks aren’t the most appealing but still a nice clean and simple design. Also has a lot of trunk and frunk room. I highly recommend getting a Tesla as its very convenient, and futuristic. It’s also getting improved a lot. Pretty soon Elon is gonna add a battery that is much better than the current one, too!",

I have a 27 panel solar array with a solar battery, so I dont pay for electricity (the retailer actually pays me to be connected to the grid lol), I only use fast/public chargers if Im on a road trip, or in the rare case where Im running too low to make it home and have to fill up quickly, in which case will only take me about 10-20 minutes depending on how long I choose to stay.",

First full circle around the car was out of excitement… then I remembered I needed to slow down and actually ** look/record** the car…. I’m glad I did! … turned out the drivers window was misaligned… so much so I could see inside the car… long story short I had to bring it back and they acted like they were gonna blame it on the window being tinted… I told them, uh un, I recorded it the first day I picked it up… lol… they fixed it… I wouldn’t have known to do that had I not seen your video… thanks again 😎🍻",

I went to buy my second tesla, a new 2023 model Y in black recently, but it had paint flaws, and scratches.  They had to send it off to a body shop. Nice.  They thought I was going to be like most people and just jump in and leave. I guess it&#39;s my job as the customer to be quality control.",

After waiting a few weeks for it, all those damages were fixed, but the body shop had added a huge dent on the hood and some type of glue on the passenger side. I was very upset that they had the thought of expecting me to take this car home. I complained to the manager. They kept the car for another few weeks, but gave me a voucher for $500 to spend on accessories plus they had given me a voucher for Uber while they had my car in service. After a month the window fell off as I drove, but a technician came to my home &amp; replaced it free of charge. I think overall, Tesla has good service.",

Wanted to share a stressful delivery story:  My wife and I recently switched to AMEX High Yield Savings and I have the Rewards checking. These banks are relatively new and Tesla’s down payment third party “Plaid” doesn’t recognize it. We took your advice and didn’t try to send payment beforehand because we wanted to inspect the car before we put any more than $250 towards it. So we spent an additional two hours at the dealership trying to figure it out and ended up having to wire the down payment. Luckily we had a few hours left before Tesla’s finance office closed on the West coast. It all worked out, but the bottom line is make sure you have a more established bank, or just get the cashier’s check. :)",

All other EV’s feel watered down in the performance, like you know there’s more there but the company intentionally held out on you. With that said…why Tesla can’t get their quality control under control is beyond me. EVERY manufacturer has the light tunnel at the end of the assembly line with a group of workers who only job is to inspect it fully and if something doesn’t pass, it gets fixed before leaving the factory. Why Tesla can’t fix these things before a vehicle leaves the factory is simply unacceptable.",

      "text": "Mahalo (Thank you) Jeremiah for your check list.  This purchase of a Tesla was a NIGHTMARE!!!! Happy to tell all if need be. I came in here to let you know that No one at Tesla  appeared to be at all interested in helping me with delivery and only wanted me to sign papers and be on my way. I stopped and said, I have a check list (yours) I want to go over FIRST.  She pointed to my car and walked me over to it, stayed for a few seconds then left me. Good thing I watched YouTube videos to know how to even open the door. Luckily she had it on &quot;dog&quot; mode for me. The car was parked adjacent to another with a very close towering light blocking the right hand passenger door.   I took my time and did the exterior in the hot sun as the car was parked with no covering overhead. <br><br>She popped back out to see how I was doing and I said, it would go alot faster if you could be around for me to do the rest of this list as I really don&#39;t know where things are located. She said, it&#39;s been inspected over and over, I don&#39;t know why you would want to do this. HUH?  She was considerate not to put her feet inside and somewhat reluctentaly helped me to figure out if ports were charging and how to adjust my seat and mirrors and although pleasant, seemed to have other things she needed to be doing besides sitting there with me. <br><br>I asked her to drive with me in the mall parking lot since I had not actually driven the car before. She said, they would have to arrange for a test drive in another car as I had not yet signed the paperwork. ugh  <br><br>Did I tell you they did not deliver within the 30 days (even with a delivery date and time they missed)  of the financing or the trade in offer? YUP, they cancelled both and I had to redo it. Everything is on the phone so I asked for a printed copy so I could read over the new terms.  I would suggest that clients do not get their cashiers check ready as I did as the terms and numbers changed (another hassle with the bank). <br><br>Back to the list...there were a few things I did not know nor did she on the list:  Part 3 Interior   Test 12 volt DC receptacle in center console has power. (She shrugged her shoulders) No way would she allow Test Park Assist before I signed the paperwork so I skipped it.  I never have found the Blind Spot settings et.   from there on..she left and I could not figure out the monitor and by this time was exasperated and did not even attempt the Infotainment system and from there on did not understand where things were to even test them without anyone there to show me.  <br><br>I am going to have to watch more videos as managed to learn how to drive the car away from there and took it to the shipping dock to be sent from HNL to Maui.  It was caked with salt from the journey over and I&#39;m glad I watched your cleaning your Tesla video. <br><br><br>She is a beautiful car, quicksilver with white interior...now to figure out how the climate controls work etc.  BTW I did purchase a car cover that I LOVE already:  ThinSGO for Tesla Model Y Car Cover Model Y All-Weather UV Protection Car Cover with Charging Port, Driver Door Zipper(2020-2024) <br><br>Will be watching more videos to learn all I can from your channel as you are a good instructor, providing details that others miss.",

I did not have this video resource when I bought my 2023 M3P but the delivery was flawless (I drove 4 hours to pick up an inventory car that had the color spec I wanted, trading in the car I drove to the Service Center - needless to say, I had a lot on the line for everything to work out).  Heck, the SC even had all the delivery cars sync&#39;d up to play a concert together for their new owners - this was an amazing experience.<br>I&#39;m taking delivery of a 2024 M3P in a few days and will be much more thorough inspecting the car this time.  The main issues I&#39;ve seen from YT delivery videos have been creaky seats, paint imperfections, and scraping noise coming from the wheels (supposedly from the aero covers) so those things are on my priority list to check.<br>Maybe helpful to mention in your video to check for the presence of the USB sentry drive in the glove box and verify video is being captured.  Also, check for excess wind/road noise and rattles when driving on various road surfaces.<br>Along with the insurance, make sure to remove/deactivate a toll tag if you have one and activate on the new car.",

Some notes: they did not include the front plate and charging adapter like mentioned in this video, but because I pointed it out i was able to get it. They did not fix any rock chips, but they did clean stains we found and fixed a broken screw at the bottom of the trunk. The flash light was a great idea btw. Generally, the used MY we picked up was in great condition, there were several rock chips in the front side, but nothing large at all. There was a tiny dent on the side, too small to notice if I wasnt as thorough (thanks to this video). There were stains/scuffs in the interior, but IMO nothing that couldnt be cleaned, improved considerably, or fairly acceptable. Anyways, thanks again! Super worth it. Oh PS, it did take me 1.5 hours and if I could do it over again id inspect the interior roof a little more.",

In the manual for the car it says, don’t use a screen protection because a damage to the screen voids the warranty. I understand and accept that. However! I can‘t see any way an additional piece of thin glass could damage it or hamper its touch screen function. Have you heard of any case where that happened?<br>And how about a phone mount affixed to the back of the screen. Would the obvious imbalance loosen or damage the screen mount. Have you heard anything in this respect?<br>Thanks and thank for all your great videos, I learned a lot but, they make the wait for delivery day even harder 😂",

Great to hear u say 98% are fine. But i will def use this checklist to avoid possible dramas later. Im in Australia and ours come from from China factory which ive heard good things about too so hopefully all good. Was so excited when i ordered then started reading and stressing. This brings some reassurance to what i can do to make sure everything is fine",

I bought my first Tesla back in 2018, and I am going to pick up the Model S today, and I am hoping for a good experience that will not lead to the kinds of things I’ve heard on this particular channel.

Meaning, you just jump in a new car purchase trusting no damage in transit or from the factory and leave but only QC/QA Teslas?  When we purchased a Lexus, we did the same deal and that car was more expensive.  It is just how it is, unless there is a brand you fully trust the dealership to be thorough on inspection which then I would ask what brand do you not check?",

Maybe.\n\n> Marian's Global Infection Point! \n\n> \"The world needs Burning Man and our global mission is more important now more than ever\"  ( Marian McBorg 2025 )\n\n> Marian needs to leave the country more. It's like *\"*BISH!!, Have you ever even been to Europe? Have you ever heard of Brazil? They don't need any help with Art Festivals, Community and Culture. Believe it or not they have had a vibrant Arts and Festival Culture that dates back hundreds of years. They are doing just FUCKING fine without us\" .... The whole GODDAMN FUCKING reason Burning Man is successful is because Americans have been STARVED of Arts, Community and Culture. The Burning Man Model and Ethos really only works in America. And It's extremely ethnocentric to think our Burner Culture is superior to other Arts Culture worldwide.\n\n> The BORG acts like the fucking Mormon Missionaries trying to spread the good word about our lord Larry Harvey and how he died for our sins, then came back from the dead to deliver us the Ten Principles from atop Fly Hot Springs.\n\n> Marian's Focus on the globalization of Burning Man is ethically wrong. Radical Inclusion does not mean Radical Expansion. Especially when these things come at a cost to the actual BURNING MAN EVENT. Hearing how tone-deaf Marian's plea for funding and subsequent comment responses in her \"Inflection Point\" essay made it clear that she wants the festival to die off so the BORG can focus on philanthropy, legacy, and cultural expansion worldwide via regional networks. Unless the Borg can achieve a massive Donor to pay for the actual event, they are going to run this thing into the goddamn ground. \n\n\nThis entire thing. Who ever is reading this: go find the video of Marian in 95 or 98 or whatever. She is out there with her eyes falling out of her head and thought BM was the greatest thing she'd ever seen. It became her whole personality. She is literally the final boss of 4th year Burners. She's unemployable if not for being the CEO of Burning Man. This OP is precisely correct. NO ONE NEEDS BURNING MAN OUTSIDE OF THE USA. Stop the colonizer Global Mission bullshit where you try to pretend you're a tech CEO. Marian fucking sucks.",

They're kinda fun, but they suck.  I'm tired of these town fairs, I'm going back to Disneyland bitch\n\nGreat point about America needing burning man because we're culturally bankrupt.

And its pretty neat, the bosses get their fancy dashboards, while we cut \\~30%  manpower.\n\nSpend few minutes watching videos of these MSFT these products, and you'll understand is basically the same thing. Only with MSFT, you have a bigger dev community, global support, smooth deployments and MSFT bundling it with their 365 stuff, making it practically free.  MSFT also use React for UX.\n\nPLTR is basically a data transformation + data modelling +  automation + visualization SaaS. Nothing fancy about it.\n\nBeating IBM is nothing. Like SAP, they're a boomer company, and like SAP, the only reason people keep buying them are legacy systems to expensive to migrate.\n\nAs meme stock, sure why not, but its not Skynet like OP is touting,",

So I'm not saying it's not an interesting play. However, from a functionality perspective, it's probably not the Optimus Prime the OP suggests it is.\n\nWith regards to big blue selling PLTR: Big Blue is a service powerhouse who sells its competitions software day-in day-out... while selling services (implementation, etc., which is where the money is).

There were definitely a few things I missed initially, for example the easy way to keep the climate on. But I was surprised at how little I actually missed after a couple of weeks. Now almost four months later, I don’t miss it at all. I haven’t done a big road trip yet, so maybe I’ll notice the differences between Google’s route planning and Tesla’s, but I have the NACS adapter and can charge anywhere so maybe even that won’t be such a big deal. Once Elon is gone, if Tesla survives, I’d possibly consider them again, but not until then. It’s a shame, really, how much he needlessly damaged the brand.",

      "text": "I had a 2018 M3 for 6 yrs, and in Nov bought a 2024 MY - love em. FSD in my v4 MY is pretty impressive 85% of the time. As of now it doesn’t know “no right on red”, doesn’t know what a school bus is, doesn’t know to slow for a rail crossing, doesn’t handle construction zones well, cant read  worker-yielded sign … it has a way to go yet. I love its improvement, but it’s not there yet, and that’s in good weather. Add the salty mess of winter in the NE and it’s pretty limited. As for the robot, I’m genuinely asking - what can it do at this point? Can it run a vacuum? Sweep up a mess? Make a sandwich? Cut the grass? Walk up a few steps? Unlock a door? Honestly, what can it do that would in any way warrant a TSLA stock surge, let alone replace cars as a primary value leader? Sadly Musks dereliction of duty the last two years is palpable, and if you don’t think so look no further than the Model S, an aging platform that absolutely pales in comparison to the Chinese U7. While Tesla outshines any US automaker, it’s already fallen behind the Chinese and that’s not likely to change given Elons wandering eye for humanoid robots.",

I had a question about how, I found, the app would set up a $50k wire transfer.  It was a circular “go to the app” conversation.  At the 3 minute mark, I asked the peeplet if they could stay on the line while I tried to wire $50k.  I detected the word “No”.  I must complimented  the rep for saying goodbye.  I’m of the age where I can remember the sound of dial tone.   Didn’t hear it, but the same experience was the same.  <br><br>Number two.  (The app developer and a bunch of my grandkids around a conference room table) The buyer is not allowed to choose a delivery date.   One is dictated,  then you have to splain yer seff when you can’t make it 😂😂😂",

          "text": "@@curlyjoe5020 Greetings from Europe. Tesla happens to be a very fun car. Although I don&#39;t own it, I have a lot of fun watching videos of the quality of the workmanship, or reading about the problems that the owners are going through. The roof of the Model Y flew off when it was driving a new Tesla home from the dealer. <a href=\"UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/KsIfY6LzFoLM6AKanYDQAg\"></a>Or there were no brakes on the rear axle.<a href=\"UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/KsIfY6LzFoLM6AKanYDQAg\"></a> Model Y cracks in the body, <a href=\"UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/oPgfY_DoKfSXkNAPq8-AgAo\"></a>Tesla braked poorly = there were no brake pads. <a href=\"UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/KsIfY6LzFoLM6AKanYDQAg\"></a>With Plaid -car overheats within 5 minutes on track = you have to buy Track Package(TP) for $20,000 will be upgraded SW. I don&#39;t want TP, I just need an upgrade. You can&#39;t upgrade without TP. Purchase of TP installation and hurray for the circuit. The car no longer overheats within 5 minutes ... it overheats within 4 minutes. Tesla announces that the problem is being worked on and stops communicating. The owner is satisfied that he lost 1 minute for 20,000 USD...<a href=\"UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/b8IfY7zOK9iVkNAP_I2A-AY\"></a> Tesla points to the Taycan and its loss of power in the second drag race, the Tesla has no loss even after 20 drag races. The American magazine wanted to make a sensation out of it, so there was a big Test 10x 0-60. And the Taycan started between the first and last run, the loss was so small that there was no point in talking about it. And Tesla the first 2 tests ok but from the 3rd test the performance drops. in the 10 test Tesla needed three times the time for 0-60.<a href=\"UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/KsIfY6LzFoLM6AKanYDQAg\"></a> Then the Taycan started to overheat again .. the bike can&#39;t even handle it on the circuit... Later it was spoiled by the S Plaid owners who started asking about the temperature problem... it wasn&#39;t the Taycan it&#39;s the Plaid.<a href=\"UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/oPgfY_DoKfSXkNAPq8-AgAo\"></a> In 2021, Tesla is ranked #1 by Consumer Reports as the most reliable, trouble-free car. That&#39;s the same ranking as in 2020. I&#39;ll open Consumer Reports car reliability results for 2020 and 2021... Both years the same ranking - Tesla is second to last.<a href=\"UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/ePgfY-K2Kp6Mr8oP1oqAwAc\"></a><br>No other car will provide you with so much fun. One of the last defects of the Model S and another model is that it can happen that the steering wheel falls off...<a href=\"UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/UvgfY_vqE92T29sPvqiAkAU\"></a>I like how Tesla takes care of customers. For example, in winter it is essential to keep your feet warm. With the Tesla Model 3, they can do it. You set the temperature to 22°C and your feet feel 50°C and the car soon becomes a sauna. Tesla replied that the error is on the user&#39;s side, because no one has complained yet. Tesla buys cars from disgruntled owners and immediately sells them without fixing the problem.<br>Tesla&#39;s lawyers came up with an interesting statement and informed that the lifespan of a Tesla car is 250 - 300,000 km, while E. Musk claims 800,000 km. Record run of 1.2 million km Model S<br>stated E. Musk. He just forgot a few details, changed the engine 5 times and the battery 3 times. Battery price 20,000 USD😎",

You will be highly offended with the offer and can sell on your own for 2x. They are a SOFTWARE company (your car is merely a shell) <br>3- I was patient…Bought mine yesterday and because of my FSD transfer it’s actually worth MORE than I paid. I waited till the (new) price was was within 10% of the average used model. <br><br>You’re correct, my Lambos, Porsches etc have never depreciated as fast as you’ve experienced but I admittedly felt the pinch when selling my p100d because the used market is now reacting to the new 😢<br>I’m sorry you’re going through this, and I understand WHY you have to buy cars so quickly for your channel content.",

On the other hand, I&#39;m not surprised if people buy a Model 3 car for 40K in California, they get a 20K subsidy, so they have a new car for 20K. In Germany, there was a Renault ZOE promotion, including a subsidy, for a 24-month lease of EUR 30. So a new car for 720 euros!!! There are no subsidies here and we have peace of mind.

      "text": "Looked at Tesla while I was shopping for my Polestar 2. You nailed two aspects on why I didn&#39;t have to own a Tesla to know I wanted to go in a different direction. Top decider for me was build quality. Rough cuts in the sheet metal, panels not lining up, squeaky noises in the cabin, and lack of features drove me away from buying a tesla. I admit, as an EV, it&#39;s like you say, as an appliance it&#39;s great. But for car enthusiasts? Nope. Second, there are just so many Tesla&#39;s out there. It reminds me when everyone thought it was cool to wear Northface lol. Not making fun of Tesla owners, I think they&#39;re great for what they are, but we need to be honest with the quality of the product, and what you will sacrifice for the technology in these cars. And not too mention, even with the price cuts, you&#39;re still looking at $60K after taxes as a lot of people won&#39;t be able to make use of the tax credit. All you need to do is look at what other cars are doing for $60K. Mustang Mach E is better for the money, Hyundai, Polestar, and Kia are also better for the money in terms of build quality. Tesla has two things going for it still though. The Supercharging network, which will be open eventually to non-tesla owners, and the software. But even on the software side, the Google OS in my Polestar is pretty damn good. Congrats on the new EX-90 if you decided to go that route. Totally Jealous!",

In my defense, I am just less than 2 months into my first Tesla, &#39;23 Model Y.  I couldn&#39;t find any flaws with the body alignment or interior trim.  That being said, of course it still happens to some degree.  I would argue that quality of production has improved.  I looked at a bunch of the new cars at the service center and was not seeing panel gaps or mis aligned tail lights.<br>   There is an odd (maybe/maybe not temporary) trend that the car is so far ahead of other choices that many people don&#39;t mind the small imperfections.  When I say far ahead I include 1- Supercharger network.  2- Scalability.  Some friends or family of mine might say to me &quot;how about the Toyota EV? or the Volvo?  ...or insert almost any other brand... the answer is maybe, but they just cant make them fast enough or efficient enough to make a profit.

      "text": "I have a 2021 m3 standard range (purchased new 2 years ago). These cars definitely represent a learning curve and may not be suitable for non-tech oriented people. They are definitely not an &quot;appliance&quot;, at least not the model 3. It&#39;s really a sport sedan more than most gasoline &quot;sport sedans&quot; purport to be. Handling is nicer than most gas cars and I&#39;ve driven some of the best. No big deal on cold battery slight lower regen---I actually like the feel, especially when charged to 100% and there&#39;s no regen for a while. It reminds you of the excellent brakes the car has and that you should use them ocassionally to keep those calipers from freezing up. Certainly there are more and more competing companies in the ev domain but none have the supercharger network. Hello folks. That alone means a lot. I also don&#39;t care about Elon Musk&#39;s on the spectrum tantrums and rants. Have you ever had a mechanic come to your home to fix a problem on your vehicle? I have. After 2 years of operation---maintenance costs were $200 (included a flat tire repair, cabin air filter--very important to do, and tire rotation). Electricity costs are way cheaper than driving our Subaru so we take most of our trips together in the Tesla and wind up using very little gasoline, thank you. <br>My point is before you take anyone&#39;s anecdotal experience seriously understand your mileage may vary. Do not get a tesla unless you can set up a level 2 charger at home and don&#39;t get one if you are unwilling to learn new tricks (in other words--if you&#39;re an old dog).",

What I do experience is hard braking as you described for crossing perpendicular traffic in front of me. I would normally not even reduce my speed as I can see the traffic has or will be well clear and yet I get the hard braking. <br><br>My chief complaint is that the car has no warning of vehicles/pedestrians crossing behind my car when backing up. My 2014 Camry had that! And the cameras do not have a wide enough view to see the crossing traffic behind me. This is my #1 safety complaint for the car.",

      "text": "In many respects I really like my 2020 Tesla model 3.  It has wonderful effortless performance and handles well.  But there are things that I do not like about it.<br><br>It should have come with a key fob but did not; I had to buy the key fob separately.  The second time I changed the key fob&#39;s battery I had real trouble opening it and damaged it in the process.  Following that it could not be used to open either trunk.  The replacement key fob actually cost more than the original key fob; it cost about $150!  And it doesn&#39;t even provide for blowing the horn to help finding the car in a parking lot. My 2004 Mazda 3 came with two key fobs and the batteries for them lasted until I sold the car in 2020.<br><br>Here in the desert, the glass roof makes driving quite unpleasant.  I really feel the sun&#39;s heat on my head.  I&#39;m considering getting a white vinyl cover for the roof.<br><br>The touch screen is a dangerous fad.  In theory one can use voice commands for most functions, including heating and cooling.  But sometimes it does not understand and does the wrong thing.  The fan has speeds from 1 to 10.  In theory one can select any speed with just one command, but there are too many voice commands to remember.  So, to increase the fan speed from 1 to seven, I need to repeat the command &quot;increase fan speed&quot; several times, which is a nuisance, especially because I need to wait a few seconds between commands.  I could increase the fan speed with the touch screen, but doing that while driving would be dangerous.  It would be much easier if I could just twist a knob.<br><br>The seat heat for all 5 seats can be controlled by voice commands too, but remembering them when they are seldom used is a problem.<br><br>The &quot;odometer&quot; voice command is useless.  It causes several displays to appear but I cannot read them.  The type size is too small for me to read the display when I am wearing my distance glasses, but I dare not, while driving, remove my glasses and move my head closer to the screen.  There are also other things on the screen that I cannot read, including the GPS displays.  Other Tesla drivers have also complained about that, but Tesla will do nothing.<br><br>One of the software updates deleted the tenths of miles on the odometer displays.  I know of no other car on which the odometer does not show the tenths of miles.  That may seem minor, but it makes it impossible to read distances accurately.<br><br>My Garmin GPS works much better than the built-in Tesla GPS. The Garmin GPS will get me right to my house, but the Tesla GPS intones &quot;Arriving at home&quot; when I actually need to turn onto a different street to get home.  In San Diego, the Tesla GPS got me onto a dead end street and would not guide me off of it; the Garmin GPS worked perfectly.  Also, the type size on the screen is too small for me to read with my distance glasses.<br><br>Most of these problems could easily be fixed via a scheduled software update, but apparently Tesla cannot be bothered.  Also, I would rather not have the touch screen at all.  Knobs are easier to use and, once one becomes familiar with them, it is not necessary to take one&#39;s eyes off of the road.<br><br>Probably touch screens are cheaper than having individual knobs and probably that is the reason many new cars have touch screens.  However, I see them as a dangerous fad which should be made illegal.",

I made the decision this week to rule out the Tesla for so many reasons and you just added another one for me.  Thanks for sharing.   I think people forget the Model 3 and Y are the equiv of the Honda Civic and Corolla in trim and category.  It is just premium priced for that class of car.

The replacement was $2k more plus additional $1k for delivery.  It was a 6 month old model with 3k miles on it.  They offered no assistance in finding or purchasing the replacement.  All said and done, we are glad we found the issue with the original one and did not take ownership of it.  It would have been a nightmare dealing with Tesla for fixes.",

Carvana might be easier but sometimes dealerships don’t have in house delivery meaning your kind of at whim if you can’t see the car when purchasing. You can check a lot of these things but if your taking delivery, if a lightbulb don’t work etc, your kind of stuck. So I’d usually talk down the price just for the in case stuff",

Do the math to figure out the percentage loss and see if it makes sense in relation to how old the car is. Expect roughly about 1% down per year. <br><br>Other good things to do: Check the energy graph to see how it&#39;s performed lately and if there are any outliers that stand out. Drive it around and see how it fares. Take it to a Supercharger and make sure it charges at the right speed.",

If you don&#39;t have access to the app, the best way would be to calculate 4 years from the manufacture date. Open the driver door and look at the sticker on the door sill that shows where the tire pressure is. At the very top left corner, it should say GVWR with a date above it. For example 05/20. That&#39;s the month and year it was manufactured. So your basic vehicle warranty would expire 05/24. and your 8 year battery/drive train would expire 05/28. Hope this helps!",

I would do all the checks at the service center before signing, make the list there and if the issues are something you&#39;re okay with fixing, then sign off on delivery and have them schedule the appropriate appointments for you to come back. The reason being that it makes the process much easier, and you leave knowing you made a good buy. Plus, if it has to do with the battery punctured, charging not working, or something seriously wrong, then you need to know these things before driving off.",

To tell if the car has full self-driving feature activated, ask them to take a photo of the &quot;Software&quot; tab and send to you.

Here&#39;s what you can do to cover yourself for that 72 hour/100 miles window:<br><br>- Thorough Inspection at Delivery: When you pick up the car, take your time! If you&#39;re okay with minor scratches or panel gaps, focus on checking more significant things like glass, lights, and the interior electronics. You can also ask them to address any major concerns immediately at the center.<br><br>- Document Any Issues: If you notice something after you leave, document it ASAP with photos and report it to Tesla within the 72-hour/100-mile window.  <br><br>- Tesla Service Flexibility: If you find an issue after 100 miles, you can still reach out to Tesla Service. You&#39;ll be within warranty which is great and they will help you out.",

          "text": "Great question — here&#39;s a breakdown to help you decide:<br><br>That averages out to $1,000 per year over 5 years. Whether it’s <b>worth it</b> really depends on your risk tolerance and how you plan to use the car.<br><br>Things to consider:<br><br>What it covers: Third-party warranties vary a <b>lot*. Make sure you know exactly what&#39;s included — powertrain, electronics, battery coverage (though Tesla’s battery is covered by Tesla for 8 years/120k miles), and if wear-and-tear items are excluded. Also check *what’s not</b> covered and whether Tesla will actually work with the warranty company.<br><br>Repair costs vs. warranty cost: Model 3s are generally reliable, but out-of-pocket repairs can add up if something big fails (like drive units, suspension components, or HVAC systems). That said, many owners report <b>very few major issues</b> by 80k–100k miles.<br><br>Tesla service quirks: Tesla doesn’t typically work directly with third-party warranty companies. That means <b>you</b> may have to pay Tesla first and then file for reimbursement, which can be a hassle.<br><br>If the third-party warranty is reputable, has good reviews, and covers expensive components *with minimal hoops*, it could be worth the peace of mind. But if you’re skeptical or don’t want to deal with potential reimbursement headaches, you might be better off canceling and saving that money for unexpected repairs.",

Also ask if you can start the warranty at 50k miles or have it start a year from now etc. reason being is because all the manufacturer warranty stuff is covered for 50k miles, so if you can start it in a year, you’ll be closer to the expiration of the original warranty, and then you’ll get 5 extra years on top, some dealerships just want to sell the warranty so they’ll make it work",

So for example, if you have a 2018 model 3 LR, it&#39;s rated for 310 miles. If it&#39;s only showing 290 when fully charged, that&#39;s okay, because that&#39;s about a 6% decrease for a 6 year old car. If it&#39;s more than 3% for every year of its age, I would be concerned. <br><br>Also, make sure to check underneath the car to make sure there aren&#39;t any punctures or dents in the battery pack. Drive it and make sure the range doesn&#39;t jump dramatically. Check the energy graph on the tesla touchscreen too for any anomalies.",

So you have analyzed his ideas and behavior to realize he wants a totalitarian state that controls every aspect of society, he&#39;s anti-semite, he strongly recommends censorship and propaganda... Maybe you know that is not true, but since he has different ideas that you consider wrong, you want to mischaracterize him as a nancy to enforce the good ideas and avoid the propagation of the wrong ones. Maybe yo haven&#39;t really thought about it and you&#39;re just angry.  In any case, meh",

Before ordering, Tested some others on the markets but Tesla is really representing the best package for me again: spaces interior and exterior, zen attitude interior (Love this so much, no buttons, and other things like this…), power, range, efficiency, consumption (my last model Y 2022 LR AWD 79’905 km 174 Wh/km motorway cities and mountains roads since I live French/Swiss alps), the sound system and the software/nav./infotainment system the best of the car makers. What is really missing however in a Tesla : captors for windshield wipers, and perhaps a HUD . Agree … for guaranty period, could be better. But one important thing, Tesla is now moving forward to auto driving capabilities and is not simply a car maker like all the other ones becoming a giant ecosystem (cars, batteries, auto driving, supercharging, and certainly other challenges in the coming years. <br>The color presented in your video not yet available in Europe, but looks very nice 👌.Ordered in grey stealth white interior😊",

Amps from the charger times voltage of the battery equals Watts, divide by 1000 for kilowatts. That will tell you what the maximum kilowatt rate is that you can get.

          "text": "@@chrisvanderstock if he&#39;s already shelled out an extra $10K for the Polestar, then of course stay with it. But at that price it misses out on a few things the new Y has such as heated steering wheel, and heated rear seats, no? To get that and an HUD - nice, if you like that - that&#39;s the Plus Pack, and now you&#39;re into mid-$90Ks. The Y was just surpassed for April 2025 sales in Australia by the BYD SeaLion 7 - now the best selling EV on the market. But delivery of new Model Y only started in Sydney last Thursday and due to start in Melbourne this week. Order numbers are not known, but delivery figures for May will come in a few weeks time, and may reflect a quite pent up demand, given the rather positive reviews the new Y has received. <br><br>Very few head to head reviews on YouTube give the gong to the BYD (CarWow not withstanding). But the combo of the Supercharger network and frequent OTA updates (major spring update starting to roll out in Oz, albeit very slowly) keeps the new Y the benchmark in its class, IMHO. I think the Polestar is in a different class given its price and fit out - again, the May figures will tell us if the Y has regained its &quot;king of the hill&quot; status over the BYD. <br><br>I think in Australia the &quot;Musk factor&quot; is minimal, certainly to judge by what&#39;s been observed at recent car shows in Melbourne and Sydney - Melbourne&#39;s EV show happens at the end of June with Tesla on show once more, as well as many of the newish Chinese brands. Not sure if test drives are part of the show. (Disclosure: My Launch Y LR arrives May 19, and heads down to the Lang Lang test track the following weekend to be put through its paces against other Teslas and ICE cars. It replaces my Highland 3 LR due to the need for the extra cabin space).",

The insulation’s been strong—I can usually get a couple days of ice retention even in hotter weather. It’s not the biggest cooler out there, but I kind of like that since I’m usually carrying a bunch of other gear anyway. I’d rather have something manageable to carry from the truck to the campsite than lug around a giant box.",

The video here makes the reviewed cooler look like a tank, but I’m wondering if the WildbearX can actually keep ice and food cold for multiple days, or if it’s more of a short-trip kind of cooler. Would love to hear a direct comparison if you’ve used both.",

Compared to the one in this video, I’d say the WildbearX doesn’t hold ice quite as long, but it’s still really solid if you’re packing it smart and not opening it nonstop. I usually get two full days without worrying, and by the third day I’ve still got cold drinks but less actual ice. The tradeoff is it’s easier to haul around and doesn’t take up as much space, so for me it’s been worth it.",

On a cold day, did you perhaps set the temperature  to 24 degrees, it heated the cabin, seats and wheel - then after you get you&#39;re like &quot;oh gosh! Too hot!&quot; so you crank the temperature down to 18 or something? Maybe then it would do this behaviour. RE warranty - I, and many Tesla owners are currently not assured by Tesla&#39;s warranty; 4 years or 80K with a lot of fine print, it&#39;s well behind the industry norm. With my &#39;22 MY, I&#39;ve had 2 items repaired under warranty and plan on getting a comprehensive check before my 80K comes up. Typical issues of suspension arm and steering interface are known problems and a good warranty of 5 or 7 years with unlimited KMs would go along way towards customer retention and satisfaction.",

I suspect Kia&#39;s warranty is &quot;better&quot; because Kia&#39;s desperate to get people to buy their cars over Tesla, so they jacked up the warranty.  I&#39;d bet that if Kia&#39;s sales increased dramatically, they&#39;d bring their warranty down to be more in line with most cars.  It&#39;s actually a pretty clever strategy on their part.  Even with Kia&#39;s &quot;better&quot; warranty, however, I&#39;d still take the Tesla Model Y LR.",

Furthermore are you actually trying to suggest that anyone who buys a Tesla is a Nazi, that is one of the biggest overreach I have heard in a comments section of car review to date. The statement someone makes when purchasing a product, first and foremost reflects the values of the product, not the idiot CEO. I am pretty sure I would find the view and values of most CEO&#39;s offensive in many regards and I don&#39;t bother to understand them before I buy something or try and determine whether they align to my value system.",

Still wouldn&#39;t buy one purely as it&#39;s too minimalist and next year EuroNCAP will drop it to 4-Stars due to lack of analogue gear changer not the only manufacturer that will be affected by this change.  Biggest issue is the CEO and I&#39;ve heard in overseas markets, though may have happened here just not reported broadly, is the fact of owners being called a N@zi supporter or actually vandalised the car which is not on but obviously affected sales dramatically around the globe and owners selling them and getting a different EV.  I suspect the reason your DC charge test was lower is you used a v2 charger not a v3 or v3.5(v4 satellites with v3 power cabinets) or else find a non-Tesla 350kW DC charger to test.",

I think that’s how it works). Or do I gobble up as much as possible at market open?",

Less politely, it's some boomer bullshit from the age of stagflation.\n\nOn balance, I believe that good companies with good products and services rise to the top. The market just needs time to digest what PLTR is.\n\nAlso, PLTR needs to prove it has a revenue stream like FB did. People questioned FB in the early days of its public listing. It happens. Price discovery is a primary function of the market. Same for PLTR.\n\nHowever, PLTR is a tough options play as a result. Unfortunately, it's more of a buy-and-hold or buy-the-dip than the standard WSB stock.",

I think the volatility will wildly unpredictable for a while until the VCs unwind their positions and the big funds/indexes put on their positions. I don’t think the retail play will have a massive difference on when and where that wind/unwind settles. \n\nAs I discussed, I don’t think it’s a YOLO play as there are so many unknowns in the coming few days, nor do I make any prediction on the short term stock price. \n\nMy point is that I left the company 6 years ago, and I’m genuinely impressed in where it went after I left. Between that and some of the big new deals with orgs that don’t fuck around I’m bullish that Palantir grows into 11 figures of annual revenue in the long term. \n\nWhether there is a 5% or 50% dip this week, or a too the moon north of $100b, I really don’t plan to adjust my position or my core thesis about Palantir. I’m probably gonna sleep through market open on the day I’m unlocked as I’m 5 hours behind EST.\n\nAnd yes, I have to be careful about what I post as I am under a standard NDA that survives my employment agreement. That’s why I heavily source/link to public information about Palantir deployments to be on the safe side.",

I worked with his wife to design it, and she was awesome/the whole process was amazingly easy. They also don’t try to upsell you which was honestly a relief (I gave a price range and the diamond she recommended was actually at the lower side of my price range out of the options she showed me). I’m planning on buying a set of earrings from them again for a wedding gift. Also don’t ever go for mined diamonds, that shit is a scam. Lab grown diamonds are chemically identical, but they are cheaper and you tend to have better quality color/fewer inclusions.\n\nI promise I’m not a ADA shill btw, I just had a really awesome experience with them and definitely think they’re the type of company that deserves a shout out",

Peter Thiel basically saw how employees were screaming their FAANG employers out of insanely lucrative government contracts and set up a company staffed with people who will do the morally questionable work others weren’t willing to (idk maybe bc being anti military state isn’t a question of “patriotism” like Karp claims it to be).\n\nIn other words, they’re competing with other big tech companies on non-government contracts whereas government contracts are basically a fish in a barrel for them. That said, the DD does make a case for corporate focused growth - however, I’m taking that with a grain of salt considering the author’s background and the lack of a comprehensive comparison. \n\nI’m highly skeptical of the company’s incentives, but hell, I’ll give it to them it seems positioned for increased success. People there are notoriously smart and if it dips I’ll be buying.",

Their CEO is a figurehead - his day job is CEO of Sompo Holdings (giant insurance company).\n\nHard to tell if it's gonna be a net positive ROI on that deal. $500M~ in pre-IPO equity was a lot to give away to get market penetration. Plus Sompo owns 50% of the Japan business, so Palantir is only getting half the money: https://www.coverager.com/sompo-and-palantir-cofound-palantir-japan/\n\nAnecdotally I heard they lost the Yahoo and Rakuten contracts back in the day (Japan's two largest internet companies) due to their mismanagement.",

Less politely, it's some boomer bullshit from the age of stagflation.\n\nOn balance, I believe that good companies with good products and services rise to the top. The market just needs time to digest what PLTR is.\n\nAlso, PLTR needs to prove it has a revenue stream like FB did. People questioned FB in the early days of its public listing. It happens. Price discovery is a primary function of the market. Same for PLTR.\n\nHowever, PLTR is a tough options play as a result. Unfortunately, it's more of a buy-and-hold or buy-the-dip than the standard WSB stock.",

The way I see it the problem is that even if the US was fully against AI and surveillance, national defense would still use it, and those contracts would still need to be filled.\n\n I don't like the idea of what the company is doing from a political stance, and the stock may go either way.\n\n  You are right though, big money is not concerned with ethics. Investors should consider the current and future reality when deciding to buy long term stocks, assuming the intent is to see a profit.\n\n As far as business analytics go, there is a fierce competition between closed source vendors and open source systems, and the market can change right quick. I saw R (open source analytics program) gain a huge market share over SAAS (closed source system) in less than roughly 5 years, and then Python came out of nowhere and is starting to get some of R's action. \n\n  It is probably too early to tell if Palantir is a good long, but if it drops down low enough and manages to live until the next conservative swing, it it might end up making a few lucky tards rich.",

I think the volatility will wildly unpredictable for a while until the VCs unwind their positions and the big funds/indexes put on their positions. I don’t think the retail play will have a massive difference on when and where that wind/unwind settles. \n\nAs I discussed, I don’t think it’s a YOLO play as there are so many unknowns in the coming few days, nor do I make any prediction on the short term stock price. \n\nMy point is that I left the company 6 years ago, and I’m genuinely impressed in where it went after I left. Between that and some of the big new deals with orgs that don’t fuck around I’m bullish that Palantir grows into 11 figures of annual revenue in the long term. \n\nWhether there is a 5% or 50% dip this week, or a too the moon north of $100b, I really don’t plan to adjust my position or my core thesis about Palantir. I’m probably gonna sleep through market open on the day I’m unlocked as I’m 5 hours behind EST.\n\nAnd yes, I have to be careful about what I post as I am under a standard NDA that survives my employment agreement. That’s why I heavily source/link to public information about Palantir deployments to be on the safe side.",

      "text": "I didn't see this from anyone else so I'll toss it out, the Blazer EV is a great first EV for people who have no clue what they're doing. My mom is in her mid 70s but has had multiple but Chevys for the last 15 years. She refuses to learn one pedal drive and anything too \"different\" in a car would be a hard no for her. The door handles on the Equinox made it a hard no for her because they were too new relative to what she knows. She avoided driving her own Blazer EV for weeks because she was nervous about the shifter so she drove my ICE instead until I *had* to take it back from her because my fiance needed it.\n\nThe Blazer is very similar to the other 2024/2025 SUVs in their lineup. My mom spent around 6 weeks with my 2024 Trax and was really comfortable with that interior and general feel. The Blazer EV is just a nicer version of that. That made it much easier to sell to her on my end. \n\nThe one pedal drive can be adjusted but one mode is definitely less smooth than the other so I do suggest trying it. The first one I test drove was on the harder mode. For someone as change-anxious as my mom, the ability to totally disable one-pedal drive is a benefit over something like the Teslas. She refuses to use it. Honestly, even when I take it in for service (nothing major, mostly my own cosmetic whims), they turn off one pedal too, I can't fault them for that, it's a new experience for everyone. My fiance also drives my car with one pedal off. \n\nThe space difference between the Blazer and Equinox does also feel pretty significant. My sister has a an ICE Equinox and the Blazer EV is definitely larger all around. I don't think it's as dramatic with the Equinox but when you have big people like my family does, every little bit helps. Maybe more significantly for me, the Blazer sits up higher. I'm little but I like to feel tall so that added height is a big plus. My mom and I had a few larger Chevys in the past (Tahoes, Traverses) so we're used to height with our cars. \n\nI agree on the interiors, I've long criticized Chevy for that. They got more things right recently than they had but they're still lackluster. I keep buying them but this is definitely an area for improvement. I actually prefer the interior look of my LT over my mom's RS. I prefer the exterior of the RS, though, so I swapped my badging to black, though the 2025 will come in a midnight edition with is a good move imo. \n\nHaving owned two other Chevys in the RS package, I can attest to the fact it's only a body/appearance kit which can be a bit of a disappointment when it markets itself as the sport package of sorts. That said, now that I have a good feel for my Blazer, I don't think I'd want it any zippy-er, I'd get myself in trouble. The acceleration is already too smooth that my led foot is worse even with one pedal on hard mode. I was on a back road and decided to floor it the other evening and it accelerated so fast it scared me after it threw me back in my seat. So yeah, I'm good without more power. We'll see if that changes in the winter when I have to trudge through a bunch of snow but I don't think so. \n\nThese two Blazers are our first EVs though I'd been eyeing one for a while. My mom sort of just followed me into the pool as a game-time decision that day. Knowing it was uncharted territory, we opted for leases on both so we weren't stuck long term if we didn't want to be. So far, we both like our Blazers. My mom doesn't want to go back to an ICE, she's made that clear repeatedly. The Blazer was the right car to convert her and it's the first time in 7 years she's *loved* her car. She's proud to drive her car and she calls me excited to tell me she got a compliment on her car (happened twice last week). I'm not keeping this Blazer at the end of this lease, at the very least I'll swap to the RS if not look at another make/model. If you told me mom she was stuck with hers, she would be thrilled.",

The reason I got one is because oddly enough, it seemingly had the best mix of all the features I wanted that I could find within my price-range.\n\n* Heat Pump standard (More efficient during cooler temperatures)\n* Battery Conditioning (Heating and Cooling) Standard (2022 Ioniq 5 SE RWD actually lacks a battery heater)\n* 300+ miles of range (Venture+)\n* DCFC from 10%-80% in 30 minutes or less (Amazing charging curve - 136kW peak up to 45% - Slowly tapers)\n* Adaptive Cruise Control Standard\n* SUV/Crossover seating position (Higher than Sedan)\n* Affordable insurance\n\nYou'd be surprised how many options in the same available price-point are missing one or more of those features mentioned above. '22 Ioniq SE - No battery heater or heat pump standard in RWD model, Polestar 2, XC40, C40 all need a specific pack or trim to have a heat-pump, Kona/Niro either don't have a heat pump or need a specific trim/pack to have a heat pump (Depending on model years) and have slower DCFC, Mustang Mach-E - No heat pump until 2024 model year and lower ranges for the more affordable used models - the list goes on and on.\n\nI've had the Ariya 4 months now and have put 8000 miles on it. Thus far my only dislikes are:\n\n* Touch activated interior lighting (When dogs are in the back seats, their ears will touch and active them)\n* Haptic HVAC controls (Looks nice, but realistically, switches/knobs are better)\n* No remote start on key fob; only app\n* Application is slow and struggles to function properly at times (Needed to remote start HVAC)\n* No charge percentage limiter (Can however set a charge timer so the car only charges during off-peak)\n\nI will say - DCFC speeds have been better than expected. The peak of 136kW is misleading because the charging curve is so good. I have an Electrify America session logged where I charged from 9% to 80% in 29 minutes and 44 seconds - (216 miles of range regained)",

I had the Model 3 until 2021 when I sold it for more than I bought it for at the height of the crazy used car prices. Unfortunately for me I also decided to use that money buying a new Model Y at the peak of the new car prices. \n\nWe decided we needed an even bigger car soon (3rd kid on the way) and I bought a used Volvo XC90 PHEV, absolutely in love with it. I originally bought it for the wife but she likes the Tesla so I just volunteered to drive the Volvo…such a comfortable and refined car.",

Good news is that Volvo repairs at the dealer have a lifetime warranty, so I can rest easy that it is covered if it fails again...\n\nThough, typical of Volvo, the rear differential is on its 9th or something version and the motor is on its 4th or something, so we got the latest compatible versions which should be more resilient - definitely seems to be a touch more efficient.\n\nEven with that, we are keeping the car until the wheels fall off.  I will be doing all the engine maintenance henceforth and installing the iPD rear swaybar, so looking forward to that... this weekend 😁",

Even with the lowish electric range I can do almost all of my daily driving full electric which is so nice to save on gas",

      "text": "Have been test driving EVs too. Waiting for the 2025 Ioniq 5. Probably what I’ll get as I like the current one but want the upgrades. The EV 6 is good too. Test drove the Blazer AWD and Prologue. Prefer looks and packaging of the Prologue. But they have adequate horsepower and I want more. Liked the Ariya a lot but the Ioniq 5 beats it. Took a short drive in a coworkers Etron. Very temping to pick up a used one cheap. Very nice but a bit large and the Audi dealership is a bit far. Decided I want a heat pump so that eliminated the mache and id4. Drove the Model y a couple of times and only liked the horsepower and the charging network. Practical choice. Elon seems hell bent on convincing me I shouldn’t buy a Tesla, and he’s succeeded. Brother drove the F150 and called it a revelation. So he loved it. I like the idea of it but can’t see myself driving a full sized truck all the time. Haven’t tried the Equinox yet.  Would probably like the EV 9 if I tried it but a bit large. XC 40 is a bit small but tempting to pick up used. I had the opposite feeling about the door handles on the Blazer. The pop outs seem like form over function but they do look cool so fine. The large wheels are a dead loss for me as I don’t appreciate the looks and morn the loss of range.",

Regardless of any politics or craziness from Elon Musk, the Tesla Model 3 seems to be a bargain relative to other cars. Getting Tesla's serviced can be be an issue, but I suspect that's true for most of these cars.",

I think in general most new EV buyers are enamored with any of the EV's to the point they are oblivious to fundamental design flaws and quality issues. New buyers tend to buy into the idea that vinyl seats are better for the environment and that  iPad in the dash is the epitome of simplistic and modern design when in fact these features are merely cost cutting. Then somewhere down the road 6, 12, 18 months, the honeymoon ends as soon as the incessant rattles begin to appear and the owner finds themself wanting to unload the car for something else. \n\nI think EV's are cool. But if you look at history, it takes a car company a good 20-30 years to be really good at building cars. A lot of the EV's on the market have a long way to go with basic quality. As I walk by Rivians, Teslas, and  other EV's in my neighborhood, it is still quite easy to spot glaring defects. They will get better over time, but we are really just in the infancy of EV's. For now I fully support those willing to dive into EV 1.0 For me, I will make the leap when someone actually builds a car I want. Right now, it appears Rivian is the closest with the R2. Time will tell.\n\n  \nCheers.",
