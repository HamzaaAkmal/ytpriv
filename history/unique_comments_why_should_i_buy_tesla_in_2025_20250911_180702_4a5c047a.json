      "text": "I’m glad OOP divorced her husband and it takes a lot of maturity to say that she wants this marriage to end while she still loves and respects him. Sunk cost thinking and emotional attachment often make you hang on longer than you should (and she did try to make it work for awhile at the expense of her health and kids’ well-being).\n\nIt sucks that it took an expensive lesson and losing your partner for the husband to turn it around. His work schedule was insane. I don’t know if the car felt like his “eff you world” moment or if it made him feel in control for a brief minute, but it made everything so much worse. The working/spending cycle because you’re unhappy and then compensating with dopamine purchases is so hard to break and also difficult to live with as a partner. They’re both better off in the update but I’m feeling sad at the situation/what had to occur for that particular wake up call.",

I’m aware I’m projecting a few people I know onto the ex, but people like this usually grew up poor and are accustomed to spending their entire paycheck even as their income grows. When he ***increased*** his spending after getting the second job (intending to pay off the CC debt), that just fit the bill perfectly.\n\nI owed the IRS a hefty tax bill back in 2021. It took two years to pay off the debt. I walked out of that financial pain thinking *I’m never allowing this to happen again if I can avoid it.* People like the ex will walk away thinking *well I survived that* nonchalantly and then dig themselves into another hole within two years. \n\nHis ex-wife bailed him out three times, perhaps four times if you count the divorce being amicable. There was no real financial pain that he had to fully shoulder yet.",

          "text": "If you’d like a cat story that’s one sided I have one for you. A few months ago one of my friends lost her place, and she was devastated at the idea that she’d have to give her cat to a shelter. I already had 2 cats, so I figured what’s one more? But my partner wasn’t so big on the idea. But I know how I’d feel if I had to give my cats to a shelter so when he was on a business trip I snuck the other cat in. He got home a few days later and was laying in bed when the cat jumped up. He was just like “what the fuck? Where did this one come from?” I admitted what I’d done and apologized. I really thought it would be temporary but she ended up in such a bad spot (not her fault, just a lot of horrible luck) she had to move out of state to live with her parents and couldn’t take the cat. So now we have a third cat. He loves the cat now, but he wasn’t super thrilled. He did understand why I’d done it and I won’t ever do it again. I felt terrible for sneaking around but I felt worse for her having to give the cat to a shelter. In my head a “beg for forgiveness” approach felt like a better decision at the time because she had like a day to find a new home for her cat.",

I think he needs to reach his own rock bottom in order for him to grow (if he can) and she stopped him from getting his rock bottom so many times already.

I'm convinced the design was based on Top Gear's attempt to make an electric car (Geoff).\n\nThen we get to the owner, he's just a toxic, fascist, man-child and he just makes me want to watch Tesla (the company) crash and burn. The signs have always been there, my annoyance was always there from when I learned the first 4 cars spelled 'S3XY', which irritates me no end. The best thing for Tesla (and SpaceX) to do would be to remove Elon from the helm.\n\nAnd one last thing on Elon, I hate how everyone states that Elon did everything to do with Tesla and SpaceX. The people he employed in the companies made all those breakthroughs, he just funded and directed their efforts. He's a modern day Thomas Edison!\n\nWhenever I get asked about my opinion on Elon (I work in an unrelated space sector), my diplomatic answer is \"Elon hires very good people\".",

A few months ago one of my friends lost her place, and she was devastated at the idea that she’d have to give her cat to a shelter. I already had 2 cats, so I figured what’s one more? But my partner wasn’t so big on the idea. But I know how I’d feel if I had to give my cats to a shelter so when he was on a business trip I snuck the other cat in. He got home a few days later and was laying in bed when the cat jumped up. He was just like “what the fuck? Where did this one come from?” I admitted what I’d done and apologized. I really thought it would be temporary but she ended up in such a bad spot (not her fault, just a lot of horrible luck) she had to move out of state to live with her parents and couldn’t take the cat. So now we have a third cat. He loves the cat now, but he wasn’t super thrilled. He did understand why I’d done it and I won’t ever do it again. I felt terrible for sneaking around but I felt worse for her having to give the cat to a shelter. In my head a “beg for forgiveness” approach felt like a better decision at the time because she had like a day to find a new home for her cat.",

          "text": "Yeah, I’m one of them. I don’t go off-roading (*why* would I do that to my truck?! The dirt, the scratches, the dents and dings, wtf… just no), I haul things maybe once or twice a year, and I tow things even less frequently. But I feel like I have valid reasons for owning a truck that are not any of these things. Three of them, actually- \n\nI’ve lived in multiple states, far away from family and friends, and had to move while low on funds. I’ve used my truck to move myself (also hand trucks, dollies, the occasional wheelbarrow, and wobbly ramps made out of 2x6s) multiple times. I can secure a load like nobody’s business. At the time, I didn’t have the luxury of hiring help and neither me or my family could afford to fly them out to help. It was just five foot nothing me and my truck. I’m not in that position anymore, but old habits die hard. Plus I still have the truck almost 20 years later. I just never wanted to be *stuck* someplace and a truck means I can load up and take myself anywhere with anything I need at any time. \n\nSecond, I was in a really bad accident some years ago (not my fault). I fully believe driving a truck saved my life, because the grill got impaled instead of me. If I had been in a sedan, it would have been physically devastating instead of just emotionally traumatic. I haven’t felt safe in a low profile vehicle ever since and it’s not something I feel needs to be overcome. It is what it is, and because it is, I drive a truck. \n\nLast, I go to the snow a lot. I love snow. I love driving in snow. It’s so peaceful and pretty. In the winter, the snow is only about an hour away from me. I never have to use chains because I have snow tires and four wheel drive. The cops just wave me through. I’ve also driven across the country in the wintertime, (twice), and have had to drive in blizzards, white out conditions, icy conditions, and unplowed powder over ice, which is super fun. I’ve never caused an accident and the only time I’ve gotten stuck was when I was young and dumb, thought I knew better, and had to be fished out of a snow bank by a tow truck driver who was very nice and didn’t laugh at me. \n\nI feel like these are good reasons to have a truck. I also think it’s weird to gatekeep cars and shit on people who have a preference for a specific kind of car. (Unless it’s a cyber truck! It’s the one exception). It’s not like I go up to women driving SUVs and ask them if they have kids that play soccer, and if they don’t, make fun of them for driving a soccer mom car and not even using it to take kids to soccer. Or go up to someone driving a jeep and give them shit for not going on a magic number of rock crawls that will thereby justify their purchase in my mind. Y’all see how weird that is right? Let people like what they like. Shit on this planet sucks enough as it is, let people have the things that bring the joy without shitting on them. (Except cyber trucks.)\n\nAnyway, people can say what they want, but I’m gonna keep driving my truck most of all because I like it.",

The signs have always been there, my annoyance was always there from when I learned the first 4 cars spelled 'S3XY', which irritates me no end.

I test drove a couple different teslas - new and used and found them all to be a little too minimalist (like on 2 I heard an echo when the door shut) and too plastic-y. They weren’t very smooth on bumpy roads (we get potholes here) and the screen got really, really hot in a less than 20 minute ride. \n\nI suspect there are very good things about them and their marketing did help more car companies come to market with their own options, so that’s good too. I didn’t end up buying a Tesla even tho I thought I wanted one.",

      "text": "Yeah, I’m one of them. I don’t go off-roading (*why* would I do that to my truck?! The dirt, the scratches, the dents and dings, wtf… just no), I haul things maybe once or twice a year, and I tow things even less frequently. But I feel like I have valid reasons for owning a truck that are not any of these things. Three of them, actually- \n\nI’ve lived in multiple states, far away from family and friends, and had to move while low on funds. I’ve used my truck to move myself (also hand trucks, dollies, the occasional wheelbarrow, and wobbly ramps made out of 2x6s) multiple times. I can secure a load like nobody’s business. At the time, I didn’t have the luxury of hiring help and neither me or my family could afford to fly them out to help. It was just five foot nothing me and my truck. I’m not in that position anymore, but old habits die hard. Plus I still have the truck almost 20 years later. I just never wanted to be *stuck* someplace and a truck means I can load up and take myself anywhere with anything I need at any time. \n\nSecond, I was in a really bad accident some years ago (not my fault). I fully believe driving a truck saved my life, because the grill got impaled instead of me. If I had been in a sedan, it would have been physically devastating instead of just emotionally traumatic. I haven’t felt safe in a low profile vehicle ever since and it’s not something I feel needs to be overcome. It is what it is, and because it is, I drive a truck. \n\nLast, I go to the snow a lot. I love snow. I love driving in snow. It’s so peaceful and pretty. In the winter, the snow is only about an hour away from me. I never have to use chains because I have snow tires and four wheel drive. The cops just wave me through. I’ve also driven across the country in the wintertime, (twice), and have had to drive in blizzards, white out conditions, icy conditions, and unplowed powder over ice, which is super fun. I’ve never caused an accident and the only time I’ve gotten stuck was when I was young and dumb, thought I knew better, and had to be fished out of a snow bank by a tow truck driver who was very nice and didn’t laugh at me. \n\nI feel like these are good reasons to have a truck. I also think it’s weird to gatekeep cars and shit on people who have a preference for a specific kind of car. (Unless it’s a cyber truck! It’s the one exception). It’s not like I go up to women driving SUVs and ask them if they have kids that play soccer, and if they don’t, make fun of them for driving a soccer mom car and not even using it to take kids to soccer. Or go up to someone driving a jeep and give them shit for not going on a magic number of rock crawls that will thereby justify their purchase in my mind. Y’all see how weird that is right? Let people like what they like. Shit on this planet sucks enough as it is, let people have the things that bring the joy without shitting on them. (Except cyber trucks.)\n\nAnyway, people can say what they want, but I’m gonna keep driving my truck most of all because I like it.",

Tesla just has coasted on this instead of coming up with more innovations (fully self driving cars have been “coming out next year” for the past ten years…) and now that other car companies have caught up offering EVs that are functionally better and a more competitive price, Tesla’s fallen off (and that’s before you even get to Elon’s antics…). But still, there’s a minority of people who don’t want an EV but want a Tesla because they still see it as some sort of status symbol and don’t care anything about how practical they are or what the face of their company says/does and I suspect that OOP’s ex is one of those people (because even though Elon was not as off the deep end a year ago as he is now he was still pretty bad)",

Overlaid into 12 months, that's and additional $580-670 per month.\n\n>But people don't think \"oh, I'm making $600 more a month.\" They think \"Ohh, I got a $10k raise.\" So, they upgrade their car and take their family to Disneyland (Or Japan, Jesus Christ the number of clients I had who went on vacation in Japan and then bitched about their finances over the last few years)\n\n>All of a sudden, they have a new $600 car payment, and they've blown $2k taking the family on vacation. And then they come into my office confused as to why they had to eat into their savings even though they got a $10k raise. And I have to lay it out for them that their car payment is already 90% of their raise, and one-time splurges put them in the red.\n\n>This is what I mean when I say that humans are bad with numbers. It's really difficult to reconcile a large number \\[$10,000\\] with the fact that a $1k Disneyland Trip and an extra $600 car payment will eat up all of it and then some. Then they get really mad at the idea that they got this big raise, and they can't even improve their lifestyle. And nobody wants to hear that they've always been living beyond their means.\n\nThis is very interesting. And makes a lot of sense of how people go from more money to more debt. \n\nI work from a budget so if i get extra money i increase by budget carefully. And i track each category, i use a virtual envelope method. So this had inadvertently prevented me ending up like your clients.\n\n\n\n>And this is a simplification. My clients with the largest raises in income had the most difficulty managing their finances afterwards.\n\n>It gets worse when people are told raises in percentages because you get people who aren't even aware of how much more they're making. And then psychologically they know they're making more money, so their spending habits go up.\n\nI know of the term lifestyle inflation, i have noticed that many people are divorced from their income vs spending and then end up with credit card debt and LOCs and so forth.\n\nMy advice has always been make a budget and stick to it like glue, but it has been my experience that most people spend to the limit of their bank accounts (and then credit limits).",

They are *trying* to remove all opponents, checks and balances, etc. It remains to be seen whether or not they will succeed. Yes, we have four long years ahead of us and a rogue SCOTUS but there are still processes and bureaucracy that slow things down. Most of the worst EOs have been challenged/halted in the judicial system. Their bark is worse than their bite, which is by design: they're trying to create the *illusion* that they're successfully making all these changes. They need to seem more powerful than they actually are. We still have checks and balances... for now, at least.\n\n2. There isn't as much danger of blowback as you think (and therefore less of a do-or-die mentality). They already know they aren't going to see any serious consequences for all the law-breaking because, remember, *they already did this once before.* This is the second Trump presidency, and while there certainly was *some* blowback it all ultimately amounted to nothing. Because if there's one thing we've all been underestimating, it's the lengths to which the rich and powerful, regardless of party affiliation, will go to protect their own.\n\n3. Their political strength is not as great as it appears. For one, they don't actually have a popular mandate - less than 50% of the voting population voted for Trump, and less than 50% of the eligible population voted at all. They *know* their ideas aren't popular, it's why they put so much effort into suppressing votes in the first place. Their power also comes from a tenuous alliance of convenience: the techno-authoritarians and the evangelical right. This alliance has already shown some weak points, such as differences of opinion on legal immigration. Another major difference: one believes power comes from God, the other believes they ARE God. These ideas can't coexist forever.",

Even Nikita Khrushchev admitted the war was unwinnable for the USSR without US supplies from Lend Lease:\n\n>I would like to express my candid opinion about Stalin's views on whether the Red Army and the Soviet Union could have coped with Nazi Germany and survived the war without aid from the United States and Britain. First, I would like to tell about some remarks Stalin made and repeated several times when we were \"discussing freely\" among ourselves. He stated bluntly that if the United States had not helped us, we would not have won the war. If we had had to fight Nazi Germany one on one, we could not have stood up against Germany's pressure, and we would have lost the war. No one ever discussed this subject officially, and I don't think Stalin left any written evidence of his opinion, but I will state here that several times in conversations with me he noted that these were the actual circumstances. He never made a special point of holding a conversation on the subject, but when we were engaged in some kind of relaxed conversation, going over international questions of the past and present, and when we would return to the subject of the path we had traveled during the war, that is what he said. When I listened to his remarks, I was fully in agreement with him, and today I am even more so.\n\nMore to the point; while I admit the bravery of the individual members of Red Army in WW2 (even if I think the USSR was awful in general), this kind of attitude ignores that modern wars aren't won by gung-ho tough talk, they aren't even won by a willingness to kill or be killed - they're won by having *more stuff*. (How are the human wave attacks working for Russia in Ukraine today? If they can win without western material, why are they trapped in a multiyear quagmire where they're bringing out ancient museum piece tanks and having to ask North Korea for troops?) If you run out of food, it doesn't matter how well trained you are. It doesn't matter if an army unit is the best trained in the world if they run out of ammo. It doesn't matter if you are willing to die for the cause if you're 500 miles away from where the fighting is happening. The Japanese in WW2 were very willing to die - and lot of them ended up on islands the US Navy just ignored and went around, leaving them to grow vegetables and slowly starve on said islands. The logistics don't just matter, they are the *main* thing that matters.",

Although I understand that these issues are real, I just take my hat off to all the availabilities that come with hard work and persistence. It is common to see a large number of people, including those who are in search of a brighter future come to this country and thus prove that social climbing is real in the USA. Except for those who enter the U.S. for the purpose of getting a quality education, human innovation, and adjusting to the digital economy seem to be ways people are fulfilling the American dream. Flaws are there in the system, and some obstacles stand in the way of progress – but this doesn’t mean that the dream is irreversibly lost. It should be noted that, to a degree, it is gone and come again. Only the form has changed. Indomitable task alone does not promise you success -but with resolve and adjustment, people still make the American Dream a reality.",

American oil comes 52% from Canada and 11% form Mexico, so if they used refineries elsewhere, maybe local, maybe in China, then America's oil industry implodes.   etc.\n\nIt'll depend secondarily upon what economic sabotage Americans cause themselves.  The way out of dictatorship is to have the dictators fail economically.  The rest of the world only needs enough economic damage to nerf the US military.  American citizens need enough damage to give the grifters friends a negative ROI, which requires way more economic damage.\n\nIn particular, Trump wants $4 trillion more in debt, which alonside social cuts becomes tax breaks for the wealthy, so figure US citizens should do considerably more damage than that.",

And they had an effective strategy. The US was losing through the first 7 months before turning the momentum and slogging through island by heavily defended Island for the next 3 years. It's only because the US had more resources and man power that we were able to stop the Japanese expansion, not to mention that we were fighting a naval war on one side and a land war on the other, because having to fight a land war on either side of the ocean would have been impossible for the US.\n\n\nI think you should probably brush up on your history.",

The George Floyd video was what made people even hearing a different narrative say that was  intentional upon seeing the video.  The government knows one video or one picture will tell a tale that almost no narrative can unwrap...take Kent State they had to sneak this photograph out while passing national guard soldiers cutiing telephone wires so they could try to control the message.   And I dont think video will solve anything as far as violence goes. I just think while the protest go on, there are not a lot of places to see the collective videos.  A repository of videos with hours of footage possibly searchable would give a likely better view of all the events....I remember seeing bad actors videos of them dropping windows with bricks during the protest and people chasing them down...people protecting loan police officers from violence...these have power to change views... also as far as defense goes, seeing things for different perspectives than the edited video from the police can have value....also having a legal defense fund would go a long way....i dont have solutions but I do think to get eyes on the subjects you want exposed or changed has to have out of the box creative thinking in this current situation.",

That will anger them because now they will have loss access to labor (if they don’t care about human rights). A lot of business folks do care about human rights, and may say, he’s not serious. Then tell them there is a way to have a pro business environment without violating human rights and boom hopefully this third party candidate will come (no AOC or Jill Stein)",

      "text": "Glad I found this post! Here is what I personally found to have helped when experimenting with conversations with MAGA:\n\n\\- Like said in the post, personalizing things helps\n\n\\- In general, you want to find things that will live rent free in their head. Forever. Victims of cults have said this, where someone would sit them down and calmly tell them that they are in a cult. Even if it's 20 years later, it lives rent free in their head, but it ultimately helps them escape their cult because they start judging everything the cult leader or community is doing from then on. If you point and laugh at them, they will just brush it off and forget about it tomorrow. Like I said, you can tell your family, loved ones that are a part of MAGA that they are in a cult, or are in an extreme group, etc.\n\n\\- Escalate their fear of acceptance in the community. When Trump is out of office or gone and the world writes it into history books about all the shit he has done, MAGA are going to be known as the loud Trump supporter for the rest of their life. (This is also why they fight back so hard). Everyone will know of the Trump supporters in their immediate communities and families. A forever stain.\n\n\\- I had a funny interaction semi-recently where I gave a very firm and short statement about Trump's threats to withhold aid from victims of a fire. I easily got over 5 upvotes, but shortly after, it got hit pretty hard with downvotes to the negatives. I guess I really upset someone and they wanted to bury it- Proud of that one lol\n\n\\- A very missed opportunity is to tell them how there are extremists in their group (extreme of the extreme) that, if they are not kicked out of the party, means that they are accepted and that their actions and beliefs are acceptable.\n\n  \nHere is what I personally found, in general... at the end of the day, these people are built on trust. They trust the President, they trust wherever they get their news from, and that is why they don't listen. If they are wrong, what is the alternative? Grief will be one of them. They are well aware that we do not trust him nor their news sources. \n\nEx. I had an argument with someone about the athlete lady being attacked (again) for being \"trans\" and I told them how her home country does not support changing IDs for trans people. He went on to racist arguments (the doctors there can't tell micro genitalia or whatever) and so I said, so every time those parents put a new diaper on and bathed her when she was a baby, they also just conveniently missed the \"correct\" gender every time? When I detangled and explained all of this to him, he basically went on to say that he trusts his news sources despite all of the facts I shared. He willingly is a sheep and would rather stay that way than to go through the pain of realizing he had been tricked on something so obvious.\n\nJust one more thing about that- these people are stuck in a web. If you detangle one thing that their source lied about, it is likely connected to other things they also believe in. This is also why they would rather stay a sheep to the system than to even so much as entertain the thought that they are being lied to. It becomes a complicated domino effect.",

      "text": "Thank you so so much for creating this. You and Evie and this thread are all amazing. I just told my spouse I found a post from “someone I would propose marriage to if I wasn’t already married to you” (in the least creepy way possible I hope you can accept 😜) and I suspect you may get why—you feel like a bit of a kindred soul.\n\nI’m a giant nerd who went to (liberal arts) college interested in everything. I loved all my linguistics coursework, then also started exploring computer science. Ended up studying both—did various discourse analysis and computational linguistics projects—while all along being discouraged from pursuing linguistics in a professional/academic context. So I went and worked as a research programmer at an R&D shop that focused on AI. Followed by a similar role at an academic lab on human-computer interaction.\n\n….then the pandemic hit and I got disillusioned with my industry and I went and became an RN instead. No regrets really, though I’m burning out *there* too—thanks, America.\n\nBut basically, I missed the boat professionally of exploring the field as LLMs exploded, since I jumped ship to healthcare. Now I’m sitting here a little jealous of you because *omg, your career (and your Evie) could have been me!* (Maybe! Once upon a time! Realistically I don’t have the patience 🤷)\n\nWhich all just leaves me sitting here (lying here, I should be asleep 😴) so fired up by how amazing your work is. I would love to keep following, I would love to be involved, I would love to learn more from you in whatever ways I can! I love the use of generative AI to consolidate the research and news that is so overwhelming these days, and it makes my heart happy to see folks able to be inspired instead of discouraged. It seems like a quite valuable use of resources to me if it helps organize folks against the attempts to destroy our environment and collective wellbeing.\n\nAlso, I see how huge the response has been so I don’t expect much but if you want to be friends I’m here for it 😎\n\nIn the meantime I’ll use Evie’s response \nstrategies with conservative patients when I can. I always appreciate an effective script I can use. And, I’ll spend more time thinking about how I can use my own blend of skills in this fight. Healthcare definitely needs some guidance for resisting too. It will help that I’ve had such good inspiration!\n\nThanks again 💜",

That's his strategy. \n\nI also don't think he's going to declare martial law. Again, he's going to get his way by making all of this stuff go through the Supreme Court. \n\nAnother thing I want to address is that there are a whole lot of MAGAts who seem to have Oppositional Defiance Disorder. They are contrarians for no reason at all. I think part of that is genetic. We come from people who have always rebelled against societal norms just because we can.

Remind them what annoys them about the other parts of Maga. We saw the mess online around H1B. There are more of those, many more.\n\nDespite their protests, the thing holding the Republican coalition together is a massive propaganda operation and identity politics. They hold a much broader range of policy preferences than we often imagine. But once republicans actually have to start implementing policy, some people are going to find out the ugly truth. Someone has to be wrong when you find out the cat’s status.\n\nThe other primary benefit of getting them to infight is that it splits the media and propaganda machine. If Fox News doesn’t know who they should cater to, that’s a great opportunity. This is especially true if Trump is in one of his moods where he is out of line with his base (since he will…entertain many positions based on who last spoke with him). Fox knows they need to stay in his good graces but his supporters need to feel validated in their own views as well. \n\nWe don’t need to convince them he is wrong or against them, just to get them to doubt. Doubt over time will naw away at them and they may not say they were wrong, but they will stop being vocal. They may even feel discomfort watching Fox or engaging with others on their side. If they completely flip that’s great, but the goal is to really get them to stop engaging with right wing media and the Trump cultosphere.",

If there weren’t infighting then this wouldn’t work. \n\nThe two groups don’t like each other but right now they’re united because TPTB have them both mad at the same things. And the two groups agree on some basic cultural stuff so it’s working to have them work together. \n\nThat’s why your average Evangelical is so onboard with Project 2025 despite most of the key drivers being Catholic. They don’t see that, they just see values they like. \n\nTo get the Evangelical in your life to get off the 2025 train you can’t call them hypocrites or point out how bad parts are - they’re fairly immune to name calling and probably like the bad parts. However, point out the leaders are Jesuit Catholics and go from that angle and you’re far more likely to make inroads. Sure, the whole eliminating public education is great (says the evangelical) but if it’s replaced with trying to make my kid a nun? Probably less excited then. \n\nThe point isn’t to make the leaders fall out, it’s to find cracks at the grassroots level and exploit them. If that strategy didn’t work then we certainly wouldn’t be in this mess we’re in today.",

If there weren’t infighting then this wouldn’t work. \n\nThe two groups don’t like each other but right now they’re united because TPTB have them both mad at the same things. And the two groups agree on some basic cultural stuff so it’s working to have them work together. \n\nThat’s why your average Evangelical is so onboard with Project 2025 despite most of the key drivers being Catholic. They don’t see that, they just see values they like. \n\nTo get the Evangelical in your life to get off the 2025 train you can’t call them hypocrites or point out how bad parts are - they’re fairly immune to name calling and probably like the bad parts. However, point out the leaders are Jesuit Catholics and go from that angle and you’re far more likely to make inroads. Sure, the whole eliminating public education is great (says the evangelical) but if it’s replaced with trying to make my kid a nun? Probably less excited then. \n\nThe point isn’t to make the leaders fall out, it’s to find cracks at the grassroots level and exploit them. If that strategy didn’t work then we certainly wouldn’t be in this mess we’re in today.",

          "text": "I'm not a huge fan of this move into the coin, but I will answer your question with the honesty it deserves. \n\nWhile you could buy the coin yourself for undiluted exposure, the assumed massive short interest in GME, as well as the often repeated huge volume on calls, creates the possibility of tremendous gains based on relatively minor moves in the coin. \n\nWe have seen this with micro strategy before. Short squeezes and gamma squeezes on the stock can lead to tremendous outperformance. But it's not a guarantee and it depends on buying the coin at the right price. \n\nMany people tried to use your logic, that raw coin was a better investment, and so they would buy the raw coin and short micro strategy stock. The stock was overvalued based on how much coin it represented.  In a sane world this would be a valid strategy. However, because shares are limited, and because people went nuts with call options, the stock continues to outperform the coin. Every time the coin went up, the stock went up more. \n\nEventually anyone who was trying this very logical and very reasonable arbitrage play of shorting the stock and buying the coin got blown out of the water. As the coin went up, the stock went up, but then market makers needed to deliver tons of shares they couldn't find, and so the stock would continue to go up substantially more even when the coin itself petered out. \n\nIn fact, as shorts got blown out of the water and had to buy shares to cover, they would also sell their BTC, because they have to close both legs. This led to the stock going up even while the coin itself was flat or falling \n\nI can't say it will work the same way for GME. It might. It might just depend on when or what price we buy in at. \n\nWhat I will say is it's nice for the company to have the flexibility to engage in this game if the price is right. But I'm not super confident it will \"just work\" no matter what. We still need to pay that money back, so we can't go losing it.",

      "text": "I'm not a huge fan of this move into the coin, but I will answer your question with the honesty it deserves. \n\nWhile you could buy the coin yourself for undiluted exposure, the assumed massive short interest in GME, as well as the often repeated huge volume on calls, creates the possibility of tremendous gains based on relatively minor moves in the coin. \n\nWe have seen this with micro strategy before. Short squeezes and gamma squeezes on the stock can lead to tremendous outperformance. But it's not a guarantee and it depends on buying the coin at the right price. \n\nMany people tried to use your logic, that raw coin was a better investment, and so they would buy the raw coin and short micro strategy stock. The stock was overvalued based on how much coin it represented.  In a sane world this would be a valid strategy. However, because shares are limited, and because people went nuts with call options, the stock continues to outperform the coin. Every time the coin went up, the stock went up more. \n\nEventually anyone who was trying this very logical and very reasonable arbitrage play of shorting the stock and buying the coin got blown out of the water. As the coin went up, the stock went up, but then market makers needed to deliver tons of shares they couldn't find, and so the stock would continue to go up substantially more even when the coin itself petered out. \n\nIn fact, as shorts got blown out of the water and had to buy shares to cover, they would also sell their BTC, because they have to close both legs. This led to the stock going up even while the coin itself was flat or falling \n\nI can't say it will work the same way for GME. It might. It might just depend on when or what price we buy in at. \n\nWhat I will say is it's nice for the company to have the flexibility to engage in this game if the price is right. But I'm not super confident it will \"just work\" no matter what. We still need to pay that money back, so we can't go losing it.",

DFV is exceptionally sharp and wise financial analyst. In the beginning, he saw the potential and massive shorting so he jumped in with LEAPS. After the sneeze GME became even more manipulated with all sorts of complex instruments-fuckery like swaps, basket stocks, FTDs and who knows what else. DFV, being the sharp analyst he is, recognized the pattern of heavily manipulated stock which displayed reccurring movements. And that’s when he figured out winning lottery numbers. He could successfully trade based on those movements. And yes, no matter how many of you here have aversion to options, DFV has traded them. If someone thinks he could go from a few thousand to a bill with buying and selling shares at the right time, i don’t know what to tell you. Moreover, options move the market not shares, it’s by design, whether you like it or not. I imagine DFV traded those movements using options, all while steadily accumulating shares. And OP while your DD is solid, i do believe there are still additional variables in the pattern that we’re just not aware of. I agree with you, box represents all those complex instruments that manipulate the stock. Once you see what’s in the box, you can predict the movements and trade them successfully. At least, though, until the music stops.",

In theory we may have been able to revive older brick and mortar stocks that were shorted to oblivion if they had similar observable cycles. The ones you are comparing are newer which is why they may be interchangeable. Easier to enter and exit positions that might not have 20 years of rolling them over? Or FTD? We just have to figure out how to beat it. I mean it could be as simple as buying 2027 Jan leaps at like $10 strike price and just buy those throughout the next 2 years and eventually the pressure will mount. Clearly buying shares isn’t doing much other than getting tickets for the rocket, since they can FTD and dark pool it to avoid pressure.",

What's interesting to follow is that these \"straight lines\" are often not \\*exactly\\* happening the same moment but tend to have an offset of about 1 day.   \nYou can also for example see the purple spike in the lower left corner - that is towel stocks squeeze in august 2022. Towel is also interesting to see as it \\*literally\\* tanked the very day orange man stock started trading and moved back up the very same day orange man stock dropped. \n\nOr another example is Robinhood and orange man stock. They have the same pattern and started to move away from each other during orange man stocks initial squeeze.   \n  \nI've decided to put my theory to a test and bought some calls on orange man stock and made some money. Then i tried to do another test on it and lost money only to find out that robinhoods stock had switched with orange man stock and now in 2025 is making the very move (precisely to the day and even dollar amount) i've calculated for orange man stock - but i hadn't check with it before. \n\nAlso: The first three-spike run from GME took 182 days for the third spike to end and orange man stock, from it's initial run until its drop on march 4 2022 also took 182 days (+/ - 1 ). \n\nRobinhood, orangeman stock... they all actually seem to  follow the same algo and also switch directions and even though we always suspected it, the more i dig the more it seems proven to me that they needed at least these two to move the way they do to hedge against GME.",

But what's interesting to watch is that GME as well as a very few other, (imho) correlated stocks do not behave like the rest of the market would one make expect it does. There have been moments, for example like today, where the market went to shit and GME and others simply didn't budge (or only a little bit).   \nTake today for example (27.02.2025 if someone comes back later) - market went down heavy, recovered a bit, then went down even more brutal and only in the end did GME also go into red. But most of the day, it simply didn't move much and if you compare it to the 2020 / 2022 chart, you can see that on this date GME went up. The thing with this whole algo theory is that they can abuse all kind of stuff to push down stocks - but they still need to balance out whatever the counterpart is and these are dates and moments where this can be seen a little bit - like a glimpse behind the curtain.",

The stock market tanking dogstock with such a red candle only because of a tweet that MAY be related to dogstock and a sell of it is, well, not impossible but imho still a bit unlikely and him selling also may not have moved the market as well as we know from the past that it isn't buys or sales that drive price but way more SEC filings (towel stock moved not when RC bought but when he dropped his filings for example, same for him selling as he sold and the price tanked 1 day later when he filed with the SEC).\n\nI would never dare to say anything remotely like i would KNOW what he thinks or how he moves but still i can't help myself to think: him, making a post / tweet the very moment the price moves is quite a fucking statement to those who are responsible for the algos and the workings behind all of these moves (market makers etc.)...\n\n\"So what is he doing?

In theory we may have been able to revive older brick and mortar stocks that were shorted to oblivion if they had similar observable cycles. The ones you are comparing are newer which is why they may be interchangeable. Easier to enter and exit positions that might not have 20 years of rolling them over? Or FTD? We just have to figure out how to beat it. I mean it could be as simple as buying 2027 Jan leaps at like $10 strike price and just buy those throughout the next 2 years and eventually the pressure will mount. Clearly buying shares isn’t doing much other than getting tickets for the rocket, since they can FTD and dark pool it to avoid pressure.",

The stock market tanking dogstock with such a red candle only because of a tweet that MAY be related to dogstock and a sell of it is, well, not impossible but imho still a bit unlikely and him selling also may not have moved the market as well as we know from the past that it isn't buys or sales that drive price but way more SEC filings (towel stock moved not when RC bought but when he dropped his filings for example, same for him selling as he sold and the price tanked 1 day later when he filed with the SEC).\n\nI would never dare to say anything remotely like i would KNOW what he thinks or how he moves but still i can't help myself to think: him, making a post / tweet the very moment the price moves is quite a fucking statement to those who are responsible for the algos and the workings behind all of these moves (market makers etc.)...\n\n\"So what is he doing? Is it a game? is it a threat?\"\n\nHe'll reach deep into the hole,  \nheal your shrinking soul,  \nbut there won't be a single thing  \nthat you can do  \nHe's a god, he's a man,  \nhe's a ghost, he's a guru  \nThey're whispering his name  \nthrough this disappearing land  \nBut hidden in his coat  \nis a red right hand\n\n:)",

If we stick to facts and numbers, remain rational and leave our anger out of our argument, it is much harder to paint us as enemies. Activism always turns political. There have been many efforts by the governments of the world to reduce civil unrest and organization throughout history, especially in the last 50 years. That’s why people try to keep an eye on posts/comments that have a recruitment and unified agenda sentiment, because there is no “we”. There is just a group of individual investors that “like the stock” and enjoy sharing information about the company they speculate has potential to grow and has been subject to unnatural price movement.   \n\nMy point is, is that information shared here has to be careful to not sound like a call for action. Everything must remain objective and stoic. \n\nIf you personally believe that buy, hold, DRS is a way to flush out corruption, than that’s your prerogative. I just happen to believe the same, but we aren’t missionaries.\n\nEdit:phrasing",

Shareholders would receive an NFT 'unit(s)' for every $GME share(s) they own. Any market participant that holds a short position in GME would need to provide an NFT 'unit' for their counterfeit shares - which of course they don't have. If the NFT 'unit' is issued by GameStop 'non-transferrable for a specified period of time' in such a way that shorts cannot substitute a cash equivalent for the unit offering - the shorts will be forced to cover! R.C.'s 'Checkmate'!\"\n\nNamely:\n\nIF they split off as their own seperate company with their own stock, that would require them to seperately publically register, and IPO. The shorts of gamestop would NOT follow into the IPO of a new spinoff company, and thus, an NFT tokenized unit as the IPO of a seperate public company under GME's umbrella would have exactly Zero effect on MOASS. I'm not even certain it would be considered legal to offer 'another company's' securities as a dividend or award. \n\nNow, if they merely split it off as a company arm of GME, even under a seperate LLC/incorporation agreement, what have you, and offer the token as a dividend somehow, that could work, because it would be impossible for shorty to get the tokens to fulfill their dividend obligations until AFTER the dividend distribution date, which would cause them to be forced to close their shorts.\n\ntl;dr\n\ngme should not partition off it's NFT business as a seperate legal corporation with 'it's own stock' if they even think to use your strategy, because of legal ramifications.",

If we stick to facts and numbers, remain rational and leave our anger out of our argument, it is much harder to paint us as enemies. Activism always turns political. There have been many efforts by the governments of the world to reduce civil unrest and organization throughout history, especially in the last 50 years. That’s why people try to keep an eye on posts/comments that have a recruitment and unified agenda sentiment, because there is no “we”. There is just a group of individual investors that “like the stock” and enjoy sharing information about the company they speculate has potential to grow and has been subject to unnatural price movement.   \n\nMy point is, is that information shared here has to be careful to not sound like a call for action. Everything must remain objective and stoic. \n\nIf you personally believe that buy, hold, DRS is a way to flush out corruption, than that’s your prerogative.

With the DD of the community, people are learning how to have their shares removed form brokers and into a position that prevents the shares from being borrowed against their will.\n\nJoin the sub and read anything that has DD in the title as it will be worth your time.\n\nPower to the People!!",

This group is generally just mad that they lost their money despite not doing the prerequisite research.\n\n\\-Bots\n\n\\-People with a vested interest in seeing the short side win. I.E.

They are against globalism as they see it as exploitative of the global south. Late Soviet Russia’s famous lack of pretty much everything is framed not as a failure of socialism but as a virtue. Being able to buy fruit or other imported goods is seen as decadent and only possible through exploitation. They think the US are warmongers, so any war they start is unjust(sometimes it’s true, like Vietnam or Iraq. Sometimes it isn’t, like defending Ukraine or bombing Serbia).\n\nThey see NATO as an anti communist, pseudo fascist organization started by former Nazis to victimize the USSR and communist movements worldwide.

      "text": "Couple things here:  \n\n\nAs a general rule, we really do prefer for people to present and defend their own ideas.  If the OP OP -  carpetman8900  - wants to post similar content in the future, have them reach out to the mod team for a review/manual approval.  I see you in the comments, but I'm not sure if you have enough karma for commenting or posting.  It's always best to defend/present your own ideas.\n\nThat being said, much of the content presented in the post is speculative, and some of the narratives have been challenged or debunked by more conventional financial analysis. While the post makes for an engaging and detailed theory, many aspects lack concrete proof and rely on speculative interpretations of market events, patterns, and behavior.\n\nIt would be wise for readers to approach the information critically and separate fact from opinion or conjecture, especially regarding financial predictions like the MOASS timeline.  \n\n\nHere are some examples of things that differentiate this post as speculation rather than DD:  \n\n\nGill's (Roaring Kitty/DFV) Intentional Market Manipulation:\n\nThe post suggests that Keith Gill (Roaring Kitty/DeepFuckingValue) intentionally orchestrated certain market movements and exploited specific cycles. While Gill’s involvement in the 2021 GME short squeeze is widely acknowledged, implying that he is actively manipulating the market through carefully timed trades, memes, and emojis is speculative. He has consistently stated that his trades were based on personal conviction in the company's fundamentals, and nothing he has done has been proven to be manipulative or illegal. The SEC has not taken any formal action against him, and to suggest otherwise borders on conspiracy.\n\n  \nJanuary 2025 as MOASS Timing:\n\nThe timeline provided for the \"Mother of All Short Squeezes\" (MOASS) to begin in January 2025 is highly speculative. While the post builds this prediction based on failure-to-deliver (FTD) cycles, margin calls, and options expirations, no concrete evidence can pinpoint the timing of such a massive event. Timing predictions in the stock market, especially around a short squeeze, are notoriously unreliable.  Previous similar predictions about GME’s squeeze have come and gone without materializing, and this could be seen as wishful thinking or confirmation bias rather than fact.  Eventually one of us will be right, of course.\n\n  \nFTD (Failure-to-Deliver) Cycle Exploitation:\n\nThe concept of using FTD cycles to predict GME price movements or the MOASS is debatable. While FTDs are a real issue and can indicate problems in the settlement process, the idea that Gill or others are exploiting these cycles to force price movements has not been substantiated with hard evidence. Many aspects of FTDs are nuanced, and the mechanics of FTD cycles aren't fully understood or predictable in the way this post suggests. Many financial experts dismiss FTD-driven squeeze theories as overly simplified explanations of a complex market phenomenon.\n\n  \nReferences to \"The 110-Day Cycle\":\n\nThe repeated references to a 110-day cycle as being key to the market movements, while interesting, are speculative and have not been proven in any reliable financial analysis. Market cycles can sometimes appear coincidental, but there is no verified \"110-day cycle\" that drives GME price action or broader market behavior in a predictable manner. This COULD fall into the realm of pattern recognition bias, where people see patterns in random data.",

These events are on a specific timeline that could happen between Oct- Jan 25.",

Is Burning man your entire peronality?\n\n> Every Video is pure BORG propaganda featuring documentaries about the Green-Washing-Bullshit-Carbon-Neutral-2030 project.\n\nThe BORG knows this is a wasteful, high carbon footprint indulgence. Including the $1 million dollar building they build every year just to burn down and all the East-Coasters driving cross country. \n\nIn '23 I had some douchenugget ask me to build him a bench so he could feature how carbon neutral his project was. He didn't lift a hammer the entire time. Fuck that guy.\n\n> You just need enough Food, Water, Drugs, and a place to Fuck. \n\nNothing about this post or my personal knowledge of fat, old Burnier Than Thou Burners tells me anyone wants to fuck you.  Maybe you got laid at Burning man in the 90s. Maybe.\n\n> Marian's Global Infection Point! \n\n> \"The world needs Burning Man and our global mission is more important now more than ever\"  ( Marian McBorg 2025 )\n\n> Marian needs to leave the country more. It's like *\"*BISH!!, Have you ever even been to Europe? Have you ever heard of Brazil? They don't need any help with Art Festivals, Community and Culture. Believe it or not they have had a vibrant Arts and Festival Culture that dates back hundreds of years. They are doing just FUCKING fine without us\" .... The whole GODDAMN FUCKING reason Burning Man is successful is because Americans have been STARVED of Arts, Community and Culture. The Burning Man Model and Ethos really only works in America. And It's extremely ethnocentric to think our Burner Culture is superior to other Arts Culture worldwide.\n\n> The BORG acts like the fucking Mormon Missionaries trying to spread the good word about our lord Larry Harvey and how he died for our sins, then came back from the dead to deliver us the Ten Principles from atop Fly Hot Springs.\n\n> Marian's Focus on the globalization of Burning Man is ethically wrong. Radical Inclusion does not mean Radical Expansion. Especially when these things come at a cost to the actual BURNING MAN EVENT. Hearing how tone-deaf Marian's plea for funding and subsequent comment responses in her \"Inflection Point\" essay made it clear that she wants the festival to die off so the BORG can focus on philanthropy, legacy, and cultural expansion worldwide via regional networks. Unless the Borg can achieve a massive Donor to pay for the actual event, they are going to run this thing into the goddamn ground. \n\n\nThis entire thing. Who ever is reading this: go find the video of Marian in 95 or 98 or whatever. She is out there with her eyes falling out of her head and thought BM was the greatest thing she'd ever seen. It became her whole personality. She is literally the final boss of 4th year Burners. She's unemployable if not for being the CEO of Burning Man. This OP is precisely correct. NO ONE NEEDS BURNING MAN OUTSIDE OF THE USA. Stop the colonizer Global Mission bullshit where you try to pretend you're a tech CEO. Marian fucking sucks.",

And its pretty neat, the bosses get their fancy dashboards, while we cut \\~30%  manpower.\n\nSpend few minutes watching videos of these MSFT these products, and you'll understand is basically the same thing. Only with MSFT, you have a bigger dev community, global support, smooth deployments and MSFT bundling it with their 365 stuff, making it practically free.  MSFT also use React for UX.\n\nPLTR is basically a data transformation + data modelling +  automation + visualization SaaS. Nothing fancy about it.\n\nBeating IBM is nothing.

So I'm not saying it's not an interesting play. However, from a functionality perspective, it's probably not the Optimus Prime the OP suggests it is.\n\nWith regards to big blue selling PLTR: Big Blue is a service powerhouse who sells its competitions software day-in day-out... while selling services (implementation, etc., which is where the money is). The fact that they now added PLTR to their product catalog is natural.",

The new paradigm is hybrid warfare and low intensity conflicts  -- Think Tier 1 operators, drone precision strikes, data driven tactical intelligence obtained through persistent ground surveillance /autonomous imaging systems. PLTR will being acting as the control tower for every NATO forward deployed unit in the future.\n\nI watched PLTR's demo day earlier this morning (I posted my raving in the DT) and seeing their ability to synthesize all spectrums of SIGINT/ELINT, HUMINT, IMINT, OSINT into a single platform is ***incredibly disruptive*** to the current way things are done in military Intelligence & the chain of command. Because of this it's my view that PLTR is infinitely more valuable than a combined mechanized brigade and carrier strike group as a **war fighting tool**. If you want to invest in the future wars, PLTR should be up there with the most valuable defense companies.",

I worked with his wife to design it, and she was awesome/the whole process was amazingly easy. They also don’t try to upsell you which was honestly a relief (I gave a price range and the diamond she recommended was actually at the lower side of my price range out of the options she showed me). I’m planning on buying a set of earrings from them again for a wedding gift. Also don’t ever go for mined diamonds, that shit is a scam. Lab grown diamonds are chemically identical, but they are cheaper and you tend to have better quality color/fewer inclusions.\n\nI promise I’m not a ADA shill btw, I just had a really awesome experience with them and definitely think they’re the type of company that deserves a shout out",

Peter Thiel basically saw how employees were screaming their FAANG employers out of insanely lucrative government contracts and set up a company staffed with people who will do the morally questionable work others weren’t willing to (idk maybe bc being anti military state isn’t a question of “patriotism” like Karp claims it to be).\n\nIn other words, they’re competing with other big tech companies on non-government contracts whereas government contracts are basically a fish in a barrel for them. That said, the DD does make a case for corporate focused growth - however, I’m taking that with a grain of salt considering the author’s background and the lack of a comprehensive comparison. \n\nI’m highly skeptical of the company’s incentives, but hell, I’ll give it to them it seems positioned for increased success. People there are notoriously smart and if it dips I’ll be buying.",

Plus Sompo owns 50% of the Japan business, so Palantir is only getting half the money: https://www.coverager.com/sompo-and-palantir-cofound-palantir-japan/\n\nAnecdotally I heard they lost the Yahoo and Rakuten contracts back in the day (Japan's two largest internet companies) due to their mismanagement.",

The market just needs time to digest what PLTR is.\n\nAlso, PLTR needs to prove it has a revenue stream like FB did. People questioned FB in the early days of its public listing. It happens. Price discovery is a primary function of the market. Same for PLTR.\n\nHowever, PLTR is a tough options play as a result.

Investors should consider the current and future reality when deciding to buy long term stocks, assuming the intent is to see a profit.\n\n As far as business analytics go, there is a fierce competition between closed source vendors and open source systems, and the market can change right quick. I saw R (open source analytics program) gain a huge market share over SAAS (closed source system) in less than roughly 5 years, and then Python came out of nowhere and is starting to get some of R's action. \n\n  It is probably too early to tell if Palantir is a good long, but if it drops down low enough and manages to live until the next conservative swing, it it might end up making a few lucky tards rich.",

Also, the exterior size is almost the same as the Rogue.  The interior is more Murano-like in size just because of what they're able to do with the interior in the dedicated EV chassis.",

Not discounting your opinion I'm just perplexed.  (I'm in a 2024 AWD Lmtd.).  Good overviews of the various EVs, though I'll never buy a Tesla again.  Quality is not there (and Musk is showing his 'I'm a terrible human being' colors out in the open).",

      "text": "I didn't see this from anyone else so I'll toss it out, the Blazer EV is a great first EV for people who have no clue what they're doing. My mom is in her mid 70s but has had multiple but Chevys for the last 15 years. She refuses to learn one pedal drive and anything too \"different\" in a car would be a hard no for her. The door handles on the Equinox made it a hard no for her because they were too new relative to what she knows. She avoided driving her own Blazer EV for weeks because she was nervous about the shifter so she drove my ICE instead until I *had* to take it back from her because my fiance needed it.\n\nThe Blazer is very similar to the other 2024/2025 SUVs in their lineup. My mom spent around 6 weeks with my 2024 Trax and was really comfortable with that interior and general feel. The Blazer EV is just a nicer version of that. That made it much easier to sell to her on my end. \n\nThe one pedal drive can be adjusted but one mode is definitely less smooth than the other so I do suggest trying it. The first one I test drove was on the harder mode. For someone as change-anxious as my mom, the ability to totally disable one-pedal drive is a benefit over something like the Teslas. She refuses to use it. Honestly, even when I take it in for service (nothing major, mostly my own cosmetic whims), they turn off one pedal too, I can't fault them for that, it's a new experience for everyone. My fiance also drives my car with one pedal off. \n\nThe space difference between the Blazer and Equinox does also feel pretty significant. My sister has a an ICE Equinox and the Blazer EV is definitely larger all around. I don't think it's as dramatic with the Equinox but when you have big people like my family does, every little bit helps. Maybe more significantly for me, the Blazer sits up higher. I'm little but I like to feel tall so that added height is a big plus. My mom and I had a few larger Chevys in the past (Tahoes, Traverses) so we're used to height with our cars. \n\nI agree on the interiors, I've long criticized Chevy for that. They got more things right recently than they had but they're still lackluster. I keep buying them but this is definitely an area for improvement. I actually prefer the interior look of my LT over my mom's RS. I prefer the exterior of the RS, though, so I swapped my badging to black, though the 2025 will come in a midnight edition with is a good move imo. \n\nHaving owned two other Chevys in the RS package, I can attest to the fact it's only a body/appearance kit which can be a bit of a disappointment when it markets itself as the sport package of sorts. That said, now that I have a good feel for my Blazer, I don't think I'd want it any zippy-er, I'd get myself in trouble. The acceleration is already too smooth that my led foot is worse even with one pedal on hard mode. I was on a back road and decided to floor it the other evening and it accelerated so fast it scared me after it threw me back in my seat. So yeah, I'm good without more power. We'll see if that changes in the winter when I have to trudge through a bunch of snow but I don't think so. \n\nThese two Blazers are our first EVs though I'd been eyeing one for a while. My mom sort of just followed me into the pool as a game-time decision that day. Knowing it was uncharted territory, we opted for leases on both so we weren't stuck long term if we didn't want to be. So far, we both like our Blazers. My mom doesn't want to go back to an ICE, she's made that clear repeatedly. The Blazer was the right car to convert her and it's the first time in 7 years she's *loved* her car. She's proud to drive her car and she calls me excited to tell me she got a compliment on her car (happened twice last week). I'm not keeping this Blazer at the end of this lease, at the very least I'll swap to the RS if not look at another make/model. If you told me mom she was stuck with hers, she would be thrilled.",

      "text": "I have an '23 Ariya - got it w/ 8900 miles on the odometer for $28K. I agree, buying one new doesn't make any sense at all. Used - they're pretty heavily discounted. The reason I got one is because oddly enough, it seemingly had the best mix of all the features I wanted that I could find within my price-range.\n\n* Heat Pump standard (More efficient during cooler temperatures)\n* Battery Conditioning (Heating and Cooling) Standard (2022 Ioniq 5 SE RWD actually lacks a battery heater)\n* 300+ miles of range (Venture+)\n* DCFC from 10%-80% in 30 minutes or less (Amazing charging curve - 136kW peak up to 45% - Slowly tapers)\n* Adaptive Cruise Control Standard\n* SUV/Crossover seating position (Higher than Sedan)\n* Affordable insurance\n\nYou'd be surprised how many options in the same available price-point are missing one or more of those features mentioned above. '22 Ioniq SE - No battery heater or heat pump standard in RWD model, Polestar 2, XC40, C40 all need a specific pack or trim to have a heat-pump, Kona/Niro either don't have a heat pump or need a specific trim/pack to have a heat pump (Depending on model years) and have slower DCFC, Mustang Mach-E - No heat pump until 2024 model year and lower ranges for the more affordable used models - the list goes on and on.\n\nI've had the Ariya 4 months now and have put 8000 miles on it. Thus far my only dislikes are:\n\n* Touch activated interior lighting (When dogs are in the back seats, their ears will touch and active them)\n* Haptic HVAC controls (Looks nice, but realistically, switches/knobs are better)\n* No remote start on key fob; only app\n* Application is slow and struggles to function properly at times (Needed to remote start HVAC)\n* No charge percentage limiter (Can however set a charge timer so the car only charges during off-peak)\n\nI will say - DCFC speeds have been better than expected. The peak of 136kW is misleading because the charging curve is so good. I have an Electrify America session logged where I charged from 9% to 80% in 29 minutes and 44 seconds - (216 miles of range regained)",

I had the Model 3 until 2021 when I sold it for more than I bought it for at the height of the crazy used car prices. Unfortunately for me I also decided to use that money buying a new Model Y at the peak of the new car prices. \n\nWe decided we needed an even bigger car soon (3rd kid on the way) and I bought a used Volvo XC90 PHEV, absolutely in love with it. I originally bought it for the wife but she likes the Tesla so I just volunteered to drive the Volvo…such a comfortable and refined car.",

Test drove the Blazer AWD and Prologue. Prefer looks and packaging of the Prologue. But they have adequate horsepower and I want more. Liked the Ariya a lot but the Ioniq 5 beats it. Took a short drive in a coworkers Etron. Very temping to pick up a used one cheap. Very nice but a bit large and the Audi dealership is a bit far. Decided I want a heat pump so that eliminated the mache and id4. Drove the Model y a couple of times and only liked the horsepower and the charging network. Practical choice. Elon seems hell bent on convincing me I shouldn’t buy a Tesla, and he’s succeeded. Brother drove the F150 and called it a revelation. So he loved it. I like the idea of it but can’t see myself driving a full sized truck all the time. Haven’t tried the Equinox yet.  Would probably like the EV 9 if I tried it but a bit large. XC 40 is a bit small but tempting to pick up used. I had the opposite feeling about the door handles on the Blazer. The pop outs seem like form over function but they do look cool so fine. The large wheels are a dead loss for me as I don’t appreciate the looks and morn the loss of range.",

      "text": "EV's are so polarizing and everyone has an opinion. I know people who could not wait to get rid of their Tesla and many that love them. I think in general most new EV buyers are enamored with any of the EV's to the point they are oblivious to fundamental design flaws and quality issues. New buyers tend to buy into the idea that vinyl seats are better for the environment and that  iPad in the dash is the epitome of simplistic and modern design when in fact these features are merely cost cutting. Then somewhere down the road 6, 12, 18 months, the honeymoon ends as soon as the incessant rattles begin to appear and the owner finds themself wanting to unload the car for something else. \n\nI think EV's are cool. But if you look at history, it takes a car company a good 20-30 years to be really good at building cars. A lot of the EV's on the market have a long way to go with basic quality. As I walk by Rivians, Teslas, and  other EV's in my neighborhood, it is still quite easy to spot glaring defects. They will get better over time, but we are really just in the infancy of EV's. For now I fully support those willing to dive into EV 1.0 For me, I will make the leap when someone actually builds a car I want. Right now, it appears Rivian is the closest with the R2. Time will tell.\n\n  \nCheers.",
